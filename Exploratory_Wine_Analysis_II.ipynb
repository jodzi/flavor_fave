      "11225 7886 Green pepper and cherry aromas. Earthy cassis and cherry flavors with slightly gritty tannins. Medium, drying finish. Don't buy again The nose is pleasant with blackberry jam aromas, but wine is thin and sharp.<br />$11.99 OH Retail.\n",
      "107714 76074 light and smooth drinkingwine with very slight acidity No discript simple wine with hints of rasberry, tabacco and dark cherry.\n",
      "186534 129157 What I'm looking for in a CdP. Current forward on the nose with a light, pleasant barnyard funk. Supple tannins with a moderately wide mouthfeel of current, dark cherry, shoe leather with a hint of metal. Moderate finish leaves an elegant impression.\n",
      "73195 52752 Light bodied, lovely with burgers. Pleasant medium bodied light cherry, musty richness in aroma This wine is a little gem. Easy to drink, delicate balance. Olive overtone helped pair beautifully with a vegeterian pizza and other food with garlic. Pronounced flavors of dark cherry and black olives abound in the medium-bodied wine that has abundant but well-integrated tannins. In addition to fruit, the bouquet offers forest overtones. Serve with grilled lamb with rosemary and black olives (elegant, black cherry, olives, medium-bodied) This wine from the Montebelli family in Tuscany is 100% organic red. The wine is made with 98% Sangiovese, 2% Ciliegiolo grapes and is a very intense, very dry red. <br /><br />The profile starts with aromos of cherry and plums on an early morning damp forest floor... that provides hints of bigger flavors to come. It has a medium-body (not as big as you'd expect from the aromo), and is definitely firm and and mature. It gives a warm mouthfeel with complex tannins, and yields a long dry finish. Hints of roasted coffee with Kalamata black olives -- nearly a meatlike taste. This wine is a bargain at near $13 and a real find for me. I'll come back often for this excellent Tuscan red. I would put this in the \"good bargain/QPR\" category. Nice complexity. Some sour cherry and leather. Garnet in the glass. Pleasant nose of cherry and olive (both green and black). Abundant flavors of cherry, cedar, and olive. Firm tannins. Dry, medium-bodied, nicely balanced (the tannins stand out a bit), with a solid finish. Nose of spices and candied cherries. Tastes of sour ripe cherry with hints of chocolate, leather, and olives. Biggish, round, and somewhat fuzzy tannins. Finishes with an acid kick and lingering wood. A big young perhaps, clearly a food wine. fruity but a bit dull and slightly bitter on the finish. Not exactly rich but what can you expect for $12. Good value.\n",
      "182322 126148 Garnet colored. Light to medium-bodied. Black cherry and raspberry with some bell pepper notes. Light tannins and some acidity. Better than I remembered some of the previous bottles. Drinking well and still has some life left in it. More earthiness an coffee/tobacco on the nose than previous tastings. Medium bodied with black cherry and maybe some currant. A bit green/vegetal on the finish. Not bad but probably best to drink these up over the next year.\n",
      "52439 38931 Dutch text bland (soft) redwine, soft tanins, deep purple colour. Slight cherry taste, not overly exciting\n",
      "5550 3837 Heritage Aromas of cooked fruits, stewed plums and strawberry jam. Currents and jalapeños. Also slightly herbaceous with mint/eucalyptus and basil.<br />On the palette its juicy with tastes of sour cherry, blackberry and concord grape jam.<br />Well balanced<br />Med + Acid<br />Med tannins<br />Med finsished<br />\n",
      "79248 57098 OK - A bit young maybe, not justifying the hype it has received A subdued nose of cherry and blackfruits. Medium bodied, the tannins are prominant and drying. Perhaps a green or twiggy edge to the finish A relatively inexpensive bottle that tastes much like one would expect<br /><br />dark inky abyss with faint hints of cherry on the nose<br />thin to medium bodied with a short finish-underwhelming-blackberry jam<br /><br />drank over two days (better day one)\n",
      "160904 110988 Lighter bodied with some classic Merlot floral and cherry notes. Light tannins frame the finish.\n",
      "55035 40597 Aromas of green peppers and cherry Halls (of all things!). Tastes of cinnamon. Dry with bold tannins. Finish is kind of short.\n",
      "108094 76337 This is not very successfully made wine. Sour cherries, no body, waterish.\n",
      "19487 14190 Moderately concentrated aromas of plum, cherry, smoke and soy. Medium bodied with light acidity and tannins on a decent finish. Interesting flavor profile for this grape.\n",
      "101865 71994 Very smooth, fruity (cherry, blackberry), lovely.\n",
      "130659 91104 Medium bodied raspberry jam and a little cranberry. Not much on the nose (but I'm a lousy sniffer). <br />This is a simple wine that doesn't aim for much, but it does accomplish what it aims for. A good bargain for an ultra-cheap every day wine. It is wine. Almost no nose. Rasberry flavors and some dark cherry but a bit unbalanced. No finish but some light tannins.\n",

      "33034 24313 Wine tasting on 11/21/2004 with the winemaker arrived from France.<br /><br />Wine is definitely full body Red. I gave it a rating of 90. Wine can be aged for 6-20 years. medium dark ruby purple. tinge of floral on the nose. light bodied. cherries on the attack, a little hollow mid palate, black cherry and fine tannins on the back end. nice medium long finish. pretty decent quaffer for the price. Sehr schöner typischer Graves, gute Anlagen mit steinigem Geschmack von weißen Kieseln bei mittelschwerem Körper, der einen dunklen Schokoladenkern verbirgt und ebenso mittlerem Abgang.\n",
      "178254 123147 Black cherry jam nose, with some leather. Rich, lightly jammy and medicinal. Smooth tannins, light acidity to the point of flabbiness, medium body. Drink now Deep nose with a lot (almost too much) raisin, graphite and concord grape. Surprisingly it was pretty balanced on the palate and had a flavor and finish better than I expected.\n",
      "9828 6907 Blackberry and earth. Soft yet simple finish. A very full bodied merlot with a hint of smoke on the finish.\n",
      "79304 57141 Juicy blackberries and dark cherries on the nose and palate. Smooth and soft with a long finish. Red cherries on the nose. High acidity, and very light tannins. Medium bodied at best, this seemed quite thin, slightly hot, and not much more than some cherry/raspberry flavors. Not too thrilled with this, but for 10 dollars, it is definitely an enjoyable enough everyday dinner wine.\n",
      "17276 12277 Purple, medium concentration. A very fruity nose, cassis and blueberry. No perfumed violet or lactic tones to be seen anywhere. Full bodied palate, smooth, quite light and bright, but big, butch tannins (rarely seen nowadays). Cherry pips and sandalwood on the finish. Nice. Manages to be both full bodied and slender at the same time. Drink now.\n",
      "13384 9460 The faintest hint of brick emerging at the rim. Dusty black cherry, smells of hot earth and terracotta, touch of liquorice. Then some supple, suave and sweet tannins. Not at all grainy. Quite medium bodied. This is really drinking well now.\n",
      "109550 77368 Light sour cherry nose, hint of cedar. Lots of sour cherry and under-ripe raspberries upfront. Very light tannins. Long and very bitter cherry finish. If not for the extreme bitterness at the end, this would have been decent, although nothing special\n",
      "166821 114886 dark ruby colored in the glass. this has some rasberry and cherry aromas, but the palate is very light and weak. being a rare virginia malbec, i wanted to like this wine, but it is thin and has a short finish.\n",
      "118165 83382 Fruity but with an edge - will improve with time? fragrant nose of cedar, spice, cola, and acetone<br />medium bodied. I taste cherries and tea<br />Long finish.<br />Another excellent CrushPad production\n",
      "195572 134641 Consistent with last tasting note. Medium light reddish purple. Lithe in mouth with blackberries, cherries, leather and a touch of earthiness. Nice cherry finish but rather short. For $14 this was a steal.\n",
      "102562 72407 Easy mid-week bottle of wine. Extremely faint aromas of black cherry with notes of spice. Medium bodied and soft on the palate. Light acids and very light tannins lead to a short finish. Weak even for this price point. Not recommended. Flat and not great Very different from California cabs. Medium bodied, a little spicy, light tannins.\n",
      "16190 11404 {A$25, 13%, screwcap} Smoke and cherry aromas. A savoury palate, quite tarty despite the moderately low acid. Minimal grape tannins, short finish. Ho hum.\n",
      "30433 22396 Colour Blackberry aroma. Lighter taste than 2004. Smooth, not overly fruity with some mellow coffee and black cherry. Quite nice. Good Valencia. Quite heavy so needs food. Went well with both minestrome and ham & mushroom tagliatelle. The wine looks Crimson colored.<br />The legs are Medium.<br />It tastes like and Blackberry.<br />The body is Full.<br />The wine is textured Smooth.<br />The wine finishes Long. A nice Tempranillo but doesn't quite live up to other Spanish regions in my opinion. A fairly gentle wine, smooth texture with strawberry and cherry flavours, some blackberries perhaps. A bit of spice/coffee bitterness. This is a slightly above average wine at an attractive price point.\n",
      "74172 53491 Cherries, smoke, some spice on the nose. More cherry and dark berries on the palate. Good acidity, medium tannins. Really nice Chianti for the price. It's not super complex, but for $8 it's an excellent QPR! A light ruby in the glass; with scents of earth, cinnamon, herbs, and cherries. In the mouth there was a nice showcase of red fruits and herbs all wrapped up in a dry finish. WIML87<br /><br />Tasted at a retail tasting.<br /><br />Garnet color in the glass, clear hue throughout. Nose of black berries with a bit of flowers. Flavors of berries and sour cherries. Medium acidity and tannins, light to medium body. Drink now. I had this wine after the Pio Cesare Barolo, which was very tannic, so it may have affected my impression of this wine. It was pretty fruity for a Chianti, but the flavors seemed a little muted. The nose had lots of raspberry and cherry, with small amounts of spice and earth. The palate had cherry and raspberry, and a spicy finish.\n",
      "190081 131623 very light & smooth Beautiful raspberry flavour with soft tannin finish.<br />recommend with pasta and tomato-based sauce.\n",
      "61544 44907 Aromatic nose of dark fruits, earth, fig, mushrooms centered around cherry. Palate was acidic, light round subtle tannins with similar flavors from the nose. Finish medium length and complexity. Excellent.\n"

If you can find it, and you know it to have been stored properly, buy it, you won't be disappointed. Score Poured deep, purple/red still looking quite young, with a nose of classic cigar and blackcurrent. No sign of jam or over concentrated/cooked fruit here. Refreshing on the palate due to good acid and clean, ripe fruit, this Menzies was beautifully balanced and aged. A long length on the finish only added to the experience. The wine started to break-up a touch after two hours in the decanter, so I suspect that I it wont age for that much longer. Beautiful.<br /><br />Drank it with Sirloin done on the BBQ for a Pom and a South Korean. They too enjoyed the wine/steak combo. Pickles, tomato leaf and lead on the nose. Palate is disjointed, unpleasant and finishes short and hard. The nose has cassis and tobacco-leaf yet also a bit of bell pepper. The palate is sweet but a little hollow and unstructured on the mid-palate, yet on the aftertaste the fruit dies away and the structure comes apparent. Not unpleasant, but not really in balance either! Mellow brown color, slight but complex nose of fruit and caramel, structured taste of mellow fruit, smooth finish with a slight pleasant kick. A very pleasant wine with our diner, reminding me how good an aged wine can taste. Hazy notes Deep coffee & chocolate nose. Again, green cabernet flavours. Not overly tannic. Medium finish, fair wine. decent aussie Double blind tasting. A good drink but frankly at best moderately interesting today. Slightly green on finish. Had developed nicely in the glass with classic cabernet flavours of mild pencil sharpening/cedar with softened tannins and a good finish. The bouquet and taste are in good harmony and give the same impressions. You can taste the sun in this full bodied, juicy wine. There are This was drinking very well at age 14, yet could go another 6 years. The wine is well balanced and has quite a bit of personality. Fruit is toned down and no longer primary, but has good cassis concentration. Nice structure with some graphite, tobacco, and pencil notes. Good length and texture. Could pass for a Paulliac. 14% alc...opaque color...immediate nose of herbs, mint, eucalypt and chocolate covered raspberries and cherries...large on the palate, but still fairly gritty, petrol, deep menthol type notes, delicious, but unresolved right now. I'm going to wait another 6 months to a year to try another. Flat out delicious...a nose you'll never forget, basil, thyme, rosemary, eucalyptus, mint, blackberries...the palate is medium-full in body, flat out perfect with filet...dyno-mite. nice fruity, tobacco-y, complex nose but the palate is big and then flat, and doesn't follow thru. it's an ok wine but for the price is point way over priced. Popped and poured. This has changed significantly over three years. Nose of red currant, blackberry, menthol, mocha, tobacco, cedar, cherries, graphite. On the palate red fruits dominate, with mint, basil, tobacco, and cedar. Finishes with fine but sturday tannins and crisp acidity. Outstanding, great value. This has a lot of life left. Drink or hold. Nice nose of herbs and mocha. Large on the palate with menthol notes. Good, should get better. Mature cab-sauv with fine aromas and taste with lots o fruit. opened for a couple of hours we had this bottle immidialty after a Estate Montelena 1996, it wasnot as good but close enough rligt talt - var lidt i tvivl om vinen mske var iltet eller lignende. Duften er flot og harmonisk, farven dyb rd med let brunligt skr, men vinens alder taget i betragtning virkede det ikke alarmerende. Vinens smag forekom dog meget overraskende - ubalanceret, med en syrlig undertone, jeg ikke bryder mig om. Good, solid Cabernet - I'll save the last one for a bit. Quite satisfying with grilled pork baby back ribs... An amazingly expressive Cabernet nose. Cassis and blackberry fruit flavours on the palate, fat and well rounded with great balance, extract and structure. Excellent length. Wow. This was beautifull. The nose was full of black berries and black cherries along with eucalyptus and black licorice. All repeat with depth and purity on the palate. Perfectly balanced with nice acidity, integrated tannin, and rich fruit. Earthy and savoury with some briar, smoke and plum notes. The palate is slightly green tinged but it isn't too obtrusive. Drink over the next 5 years. Tasted at Yalumba Cellar Door This almost merlot-like dark purple wine was very soft, lacking structure and any sort of substansive finish. I have 2 more bottles of this -- hopefully this was just an off-bottle. Seemed very mature given its real age, but much improved over the second bottle. good QPR still a little tart and not as big as other cabs. 14% alc...100% Cab Sauv from Coonawarra...can sense the American oak & dill like qualities right off the bat, not a bad thing, just pronounced, sweet red fruits, minty...medium-bodied and classic Yalumba style, never over-extracted or alcoholic, odd in this category, loads of that Coonawarra character, with almost a Rutherford like dust quality as well. Nice Cab. *** out of *****. Deep purple in colour this wine had a dusty, earthy nose showing liquorice and leaf tobacco characters with a hint of sweetness. The palate is pretty rustic - actually seemed a bit all over the place - spice, acid and tannins all hit you at once. Opened 3 hr prior to drinking. First time I had this wine was at a large wine tasting featuring about 100 wines from all over Australia. The Yalumba table was one of the last ones I visited so the palate was tiring a little. Despite this I thought the '02 Menzies and the '02 Octavius stood out to be 2 of the best wines of the day.<br /><br />when I decided to drink this I wondered whether the amount of alcohol I had consumed at the tasting prior to trying this wine had influenced my decision to purchase. My worries were unwaranted in the end. This is a very elegant wine. Medium-bodied, it had a lovely nose and an even stronger palate. There was plenty of cassis on the palate but very little greeness (which is a typical coonawarra trait) and the balance was impeccable. The wine was still evolving by the time we finished the bottle which suggusts it still has another 5-8 years left in it yet. Past vintages I've tried typically drink well for at least 10 years.<br /><br />A classy wine from a not so good vintage. Still a good wine although the acid was poking out a little and it seemed a bit green. Consistent with my previous notes. Good wine but will never be a 'great' Menzies IMO (product of the cool vintage more than anything). Very savory good aftertaste with lingering finish Cool sensation (eucalyptuys? maybe) Classic aussi power Night 1 Fruity but elegant wine with black currant on the nose along with some truffels. Sweet. Rounded tannins and it turned out to be very drinkable at this time. I am not sure it will evolve much more but certainly weel worth its price. Nose closed up tight. Youthful and well balanced but quite austere at this stage. Give this a couple more years. Taken to Aussie OL in Laguna. Red fruit and bit of green/asparagus on the finish. It was off-putting to me, but some didn't like it. I thought it was drinking nicely, closer to a young Bdx than to a Cali Cab. Eucalyptus and bluberries on the nose. A bit on light side as far as body goes but decent palate of fruit, oak and nuances. ready to drink. Tight and slightly tannic but good fruit I agree with most recent notes. Corking it overnight seemed to only increase the tartness of the fruit. count me out Full; Round nose; Soft; Very easy drinking Notes of balsam wood, black and red currants, sweet tobacco, and dried herbs. Acidity a bit on the high side. Tasted at the retail tasting. This is terribly shut down right now. Dusty/chalky nose of stem and smoke. On the palate, black currant and loamy earth. Stemmy finish, with green, chalky tannins. I do not recommend drinking this now. No rating. Rather herbaceous and lean for NW wine. Will need to reexamine under better circumstances. Color with rosemary roasted beef. Fabulous cab. Had Mondavi Reserve cab same night and although Mondavi reserve usually is very good, it was sour and lacking in comparison Surprisingly Bordeauxlais for an Australian cab, with a shifting nose that's enticing at best and well-developed secondary nuances with a (too) acidic backbone. This isn't getting any better in the next five years and I don't know if the fruit will last long enough to carry it beyond that. Strong fruit depth, plum, good finsih,firm tannins Plum with a strong mid palate of dry sweet fruit and good finish Not your typical Aussie. Downright austere. I do think there is enough fruit balanced with green pepper and white pepper and scorched earth to give this wine some intrigue. This would be fun to put in blind with old world and see if people could guess. it's not easy being oprah's menge....fantastic.. Despite the bad press here thus far, I found this to be outstanding. Nice fruit, blackberries, plenty of tannins, and long finish. Will benefit from more aging, and I am looking forward to the next one. Fun wine, thoroughly enjoyed this one. Creme de Casis, blackberries and tobacco. Aging well. Very nice and complex wine. wow! this a powerful wine. dark dark colour and a massive nose of dark fruit. the finish is a bit spicy and hot but i thik that will mellow with a bit more time. This is either shut down right now or the worst $50 bottle of wine I've ever had. Spicy, woody, very vegetal aroma. Some purple fruit on the palate. Little complexity and high acidity. I'll hold off on final judgement, because this can't be right. D Muted nose, mineral YES. Good quality to price ratio. Looks black in the glass, an above average Oz CB with good blackberry fruits, smooth tannins and not too hot (13.5), relatively speaking. I remember drinking this back in 1999 and really liked it. Easy drinking, good without food. A \"buy it, if you see it wine\" rather than one you would buy to keep. But, very acceptable. Loved this as always. Nice plum (black fruits too) and mint on the nose. Although the tannins aren't as soft as I remember the last bottle being, there was sufficient fruit on the palate and a good finish. This is almost austere and probably needs some more time to unfold. But, decanted for an hour or so and loved it.<br />Just read through some of the earlier notes and i concur with whoever mention the Bordeaux qualities of this wine. Not quite opaque as it clears near the edges of the glass. Near black in color. Nice floral characteristics on the nose lead to a disappointing palate. Lacking fruit and a distinct smokiness take away from a smooth wine with mostly resolved tannins. Somewhat thin and short on the finish compared to previous bottles which I have loved. Maybe a bad bottle or getting over the hill. Disappointing. Pretty nice bottle of wine but nothing special. It's an everyday wine with a bit of dis-coordination on its flavors. Drink now. I recently tasted the 2002 vintage of this wine, and was very unimpressed. I think I summed it up nicely when I said it was \"a bit all over the place.\" Given that review I decided to drink the 2004 in my cellar - boy was I surprised how different it was! <br /><br />Deep purple in colour this vintage had a mainly savoury nose - mineral, herb and oak characters, with a hint of candied fruit at the end. The palate was intense! Great depth of fruit, excellent oak integration and supple tannins. Very nice indeed.<br /><br />\"Improvements in the vineyard have put Menzies, head and shoulders above the old style\" Huon Hooke and Bob Campbell, Australian Gourmet Traveller, December '07/January '08 issue. I think I agree! No formal notes. Some green notes on the nose. Gives hints of a Napa Cab. Smooth and silky. Just barely ready to drink. Drink or hold. Excellent. 90+ good but could use a little time. big tannins. Major cork damage No formal note. Really love this wine with Coonawarra typicity, perfectly subtle minty in the mid-palate. Just remember to decant if I put my hands on another one of these as there is a ton of sediments... and it's got a long life ahead. Nose displays rich dark fruit-complexity. Hard to believe this was scored under 90. Taste reveals what the nose implies. Some complexity with a dark fruit finish. The finish does not last 30+ seconds however-it does have a polished ending one can enjoy. While complexity of taste and finish does not bode for a score in the 93+ range it also demands in my opinion a score around 91 reflecting the fact this wine has some refined attributes. After being ppened 30+ minutes nose offers up coffee and dark chocolate. I will be buying more. I like this wine. None of that bright cheap cherry taste. This wine had dark colour and the fruit was a bit overpowered by some tannins - another few years and this should be an excellent marriage of fruit and oak. Lovely - solidly built - as another reviewer noted similar to a California cab on the nose - mineral, herb (a little green maybe). Tannins backing it all up but not dominating. Nice finish. Would buy more if they become available. Reddish purple in colour and opaque but lightening at the edges. BANG!.......nose of Bazooka bubblegum mixed with barnyard, tons of blackcurrant and blackberry fruit, lots of alcohol and nail polish. Lovely on the palate.......bitter mocha coffee, lovely deep rich blackberries and peach stones, tannic but not too much so. Good length with some resonance but austere, brooding and headachingly young. This could be a great wine in 10-15 years. Purple, through & through. Initial nose is all alcohol. Nice mouthfeel, silky, big time wave of cassis, blue fruits, sweeping tannins, dry lingering finish. Nice. With a goat cheese salad and time in the glass the nose opens up to match the palte, with a bit of dusty fruit. Bitterness gone, cabby, like this, nice effort. Well made young Aussie. This will give you bad gas. Young 05? Smell like Ebenezers . Quite nice. Aussie  Ken/Kells. USA  Tim/Bosh Ripe and floral up front. Candied red rose petals and maraschino cherry. Trs bon vin, bien fait. Rien n'accroche, mais pas de wow factor. Trs digeste pour un australien (mes prjugs diminueront). Bcp trop cher toutefois. Bcp de vin de la moiti du prix en offre autant.  revoir demain avec le reste de la bouteille. Perfect Saint Valentin wine. Been a while since I tasted a 40$ + wine that deserved its selling price (I'm from an overtaxed country). Accompanied perfectly my spicy tomato seafood pasta and this evening... I'm a happy man ! superb, fruity nose, short finish The cigar is the baby brother of this wine. Black currants, with some grip, shows some secondary. Huge Cabernet, plenty of rich fruit with hint of cassis - alcohol giving weight but no heat, lots of tobbacco leaf, some mint and lovely oak support - backed by powdery drying tannins - no rush on this one and should come together further over the next 2-3 years Ripe red fruit, flabby palate. Nose Nose Really big and rich. Needs way more time.\"\n",

      "I had heard great things about this winery from more than one person so I was pumped that my dad gave me a bottle after he got back from WW. This must be their entry level blend as it didn't have much going on except a little bit of fruit and more oak that I would have expected. Mostly cab and merlot . Not sure how much this costs, but I don't think I'll be buying any. 85pts. Needs about an hour to open up, then there is quite a difference. First taste was a little harsh. Set decanted for one hour and the wait is worth it. Scent of fruit and light mineral. Taste of cherry, cola and an anise finish. Smooth yet complex. The four of us are giving this an 88. Young but refined, very elegant. Could use more time or decant in advance. Nice bottle. Opened and drank with a 2 hour decant. Medium dark color lightening at its edges. Distinctive notes of crushed rock, rose petal, red currant and cherry throughout the nose and alive on the palate. Smooth feel and fine firm tannins along with secondary notes of cedar, cocoa and tea. Nice juicy lingering finish. This is a delicious wine, drinking well now with a decant and nicely structured for medium-term aging. 92+\n",

I paired it with Chocolate Lava cake. I had this bottle in my wine rack for about 3 months. I bought it from the vineyard and I have to say everything that I tried at this vineyard was really good.

Great spice & concentrated fruit, long finish, great balance, full body, very fruit focused, mellow tannin Great stuff, drank half the bottle at Monarch Cafe, and kept the rest overnight. Used some to cook with (Bolognese sauce) and drank the last of it. Really great GSM red. Following a festival with Michigan wines (whites can be solid; reds have flavor but no complexity or body). I needed real wine. PnP. Nearly opaque ruby/brick red. Wild tart cherries with multi-spice, heavy on the pepper. Long finish. Continued to evolve and soften. This is just what I needed Decanted for 90 min. and served two bottles with stuffed pork loin. Great pairing. Rich dark red. Full body. Classic GSM. Wonderful wine. Had a headache after this one and it wasnt only me. I would have given more points otherwise. Forgot to change my drinking window, and popped another. Damn! It's a great wine, and will be even better if I can remember not to drink it too soon. My new window is 2013-17, but I suspect it will go until 2020 or more. PS Decanted 1 hour. Deep burgundy color. Body full- . Great flavor. Zin instead of M in the GSM is nice twist. Still a little tight. I am going to keep the rest of my stash for a few extra years. Window will be '13 - xxxx.

      "Grenache at Momo's Dark, black red color; hot, earthy, peppery, oak nose; stiff, oaky, pepper palate with high tannins; medium tannic finish Nasty. Cloudy, oxidized, funky just bad. I expected more from Kermit Lynch and Texier, especially after the success of bottle one. Something, probably a spoilage organism, seems to have affectet this in the bottle but the defect is due to bad winemaking, not a bad external factor like cork so it is fair to rate is for shit. Drank during son's baptism weekend with family so no detailed notes. I remember it was better than I thought it would be and certainly worth $18. terribly acidic. Too bad. Liked this last time. Liked this alot again. Very minerally. the black olive, mineral type of syrah rather than the fruit and chocolate version. But very enjoyable with dinner. Seems like the previously noted village designate makes all the difference. So this time I noticed that the wine is Vieilles Vignes des Cadinieres. Were the last two just the regular St. Gervais or not? Anyhow, at first no noticable nose and little taste - but none of the flaws of the prior two bottles. Then it opened up in the decanter. Would have been better a year or two ago but still nice. Very grenache with a herbaceousnecss coming out after a few hours. Herbs, tea, raspberries and cherries. dark red, some brick<br />N A more red toned nose that the Chusclan, with a charming spiciness and savouryness. A brighter wine on the palate also than the Chusclan with a more red oriented and acidic style, but still with upright tannins. It doesn't seem so ripe and dark as the Chusclan. Ripe but again light on its feet. Very enjoyable. Enjoyed this Grenache blend very much, which is not too perfumed. Red berry and cherry fruit, kept nicely in check by just the right amount of gritty, earthy notes in the midpalate and aftertaste. Light to medium ruby. Leafy nose. Licorice, little fruit, very green profile, and somewhat thin. Unimpressive. I really enjoyed this. Fruity and forward. Very berry. I liked the crunch of acidity and the touch of earth. I think this is a versatile wine, and would appeal to a great deal of drinkers. However, I noted a high toned soapy note, sort of like dish detergent, that I found distracting. This is the only element that keeps this wine from commanding a wholly positive note. This persnickity complaint may be due to my general avoidance (don''t want to say aversion) to Rhone wines not from the north. I have also experienced this sort of perfumey fragrance in the CdP's that my father in law loves. Could be endemic to the species. For all the griping (or belaboring) I would happily drink this many more times.\n",

      "Thin on the finish and a touch dark. Group #7, My #11 - Full soft red violet color. Big spicy canned red fruit nose - a bit off putting. Awkward tannic black fruit. Just an odd wine from my perspective. Good fruit and spice and a long finish. Black pepper and plum. finally mellowed really nice after decant Outastnding. Ripe, but not overly so. Plenty of complexity. Strawberry, brambles, aromatic herbs, coffee and incense. Long warm finish. This wine stood out as almost over ripe in this tasting. Black cherry, black berry, plum, some garrigue, and earth flavors w/ medium depth. Comes across as very young for an '01 and slightly odd. 90pts on day 2. I'm very surprised by this wine. It started very very oaky, so much that I put the bottle back in the fridge and hope for the best.<br />A week later, still oaky but not to the point of being undrinkable anymore. Very ripe, borderline overripe, raisiny with black fruits and a hint of leather. Full body, nice texture.<br />I was not expected that from this wine and it is somehow a big disappointment. Simple ripe fruit, but finely balanced. Not scored. pretty light for c9dp. in the beginning too herbacious, but later becomes more harmonious. tastes a bit like a 1cru burg. candiy, caramel. sweet. pleasant. but not supergreat not bad. evolving in a pretty strange fashion. tried first bottle 2 years ago and it was not drinkable. green medicine. drank another a year ago - was more like cdp but needed time. now it is turning burgundian! i like the direction of this and will keep trying...\n",

      "The nose was full of burnt forest, with some licorice and blueberry liqueur. The palate had blackberry and cedar, and finished with some licorice and earth. Decanted for 9 hours. Purple/black in color. No heat at all from this 16.5% wine. Deep brooding nose of cedar, licorice and blackberry which was glorious. To be honest, the flavors did not reach the heights of the nose until the wine had been open for 10 hours. It is amazing how much air time this wine needs. At first, the palate only showed some dark berries along with smooth tannins. At the 10 hour mark, the mouth was AWESOME just like the nose, with wonderful mouth-filling flavors of blackberries and blueberries. A huge but completely balanced wine. I was craving more when we finished the bottle. My impressions of this wine continue to be very positive over the years. It is big, but it has backbone, great fruit, interesting secondary character and a nice mouthfeel. Still seems young but I don't know that holding will pay off much. I've had this a few times and I cannot put my finger on what is going on. The nose is huge and interesting. This is a full-flavored wine that manages to be complex and in my amateur opinion achieves balance. This wine is certainly not for everybody. Not as tasty as I had a year ago. Maybe a bottle variation or I just PnP'd and didn't allow it to get its wind. Minty and full force on the nose. Extracted, rich, almost savory with its full bore power. Massive and unforgiving. This sucker is going to take no prisoners. I don't have all the descriptive verbage but this is an excellent big drinking Shiraz. There is such a huge disparity when you drink wine with friends around a meal rather than with a group of wine drinkers examining wines in a line up. Australian High Alcohol 16+ with dense blue fruits. WOW. Came in that slick three box set. Now I can't drink the second one because I wouldl only have one left Notes from rather foggy memory- drank july '08<br />opened LATE, like late at night, 3 a.m.?<br />- thick, huge blueberry pie. That's what i remember most, massive Blueberry. Great feel, creamy. Can't really remember heat on the nose or in the mouth. Aussie for sure. Can't say mush else. It was great. Left it out in the bottle for a day uncorked, better with more air, day two, still amazing. Comparing it to other aussie shiraz I'd say 96+, prolly won't open other bottle for a couple years... This wine is just amazing. concentrated black and blue fruit power this beast,along with pepper and some oaky accents. Very consistent with other bottles I have previously enjoyed. The bottle took about an hour in the decanter to completely open up, but as with most good reds, kept developing subtle and pleasant changes throughout the evening. Seemed better than the 97 Ornellaia we had the previous night. That says a lot. 2nd bottled to date and this is my favorite Auzzie Shiraz, better than carnival of love and block 6. Blueberries and black raspberries galore. This is a major fruit forward wine with a high alcohol content, yet while drinking this, you don't notice any overwhelming heat, though spices and white pepper. This was heavy, but like a fine liquer made for sipping. I even found this better than the penfolds grange I enjyed earlier this year. A+ This wine was drunk while descending Mt Rainer and tasted like a gift from the Gods, I tasted a toasty blueberry liquer, and like the bottle shows, it's magical in the power of envigorating a worn out climber. Could compete with my favorite Aus wines, like Amery Kay Brothers Block 6, from 2004 or 2005. High alcohol, definitely not for those afraid of some heat. What the hell is this? It's like drinking a Sumo wrestler. Fat, creamy, pruney, peppery blackberry, massive extract, unforgiving bruiser of a wine. Absolutely lacking structure, complexity, & nuance. While enjoyable as a curiosity, this will meet a gruesome end once the fruit starts to mellow. An insult to the winemaking tradition; a hedonistic parkerized McGriddler of a wine and I'm not even a member of the antiflavor elite! $50, 79 points or something. Hard to rate as it has its merits but is certainly not what I would call a 'good' wine. Massive. Needs plenty of air! Menthol or almost eucalyptol on initial nose. After a half hour some mint showed up & then after another hr beautiful red fruit with mint on the nose. Nice complexity on the modest side. Raspberries & cherries up front with mild acidity & tannins. Moderate finish with the longing to have another sip.\n",

      "Hard not to rate this up more from the last time but it is still emerging and I need some place to go with the rating. Same red currant on the nose with tiny bite on the roof of the mouth - peppery kind of thing. Decanted for an hour again but this didn't completely open up until more than another hour had passed. Very smooth in the mouth, delicious dark plum/prune kind of thing in the back of the mouth as it slid away with just a tiny touch of licorice. Very nice! Decanted and gave it about an hour and it still needed to open some after that. Red Currant and dark fruit on the nose giving way to gentle tannin and a mouthfull of full dark fruit with a touch of peppery spice. Really good stuff. This is going to just get better. Left bank blend. <br />Aromatics of wet stone, ripe plums and earth tones. Approachable tannins and solid entry on the palate. Not as masculine as a CA CS but still big! Espresso Coffee bean , toast and dark plum on the palate<br />A solid long elegant finish. This wine will cellar for many, many years.\n",

      "Poured at a retailer tasting. Ruby color, with red fruit notes and chewy tannins, finishing with a nice spicy quality. Very enjoyable. A pleasant surprise. I was at my usual wine shoppe when the reps were in talking to the owner. I was at a local restaurant and they had the wine on their list. An excellent Cab! I would highly recommend. One of my favorites! This is a great wine. This was consumed with several dinners over the course of the work week. This is truly a great find for everyday dinner wine. A wonderful QPR. The thing I like the most about this wine is it is ready to drink now, it is fruit forward, and yet it is smooth and has no bitterness or other negative traits. Many more expensive wines cannot live up to its standard. a lot of fruits, quite a bit of tannins, nice and drinkable Fruit-forward, and not complex at all. Very drimkable and enjoyable. So new world; I doubt worth cellaring. We poured this for an open house at our business, most clients not knowledgable in wines, but very well received. Nose of pomegranates (sp?) and red roses. Mouth has flavor of bright berries, sweet cherries. Short finish. No hint of bitterness; no tannins to speak of. Not complex, so if you are in a thinking mood, go elsewhere. Enjoyable and nonthinking mood, very delightful. Expressive cassis and plum aromas. There's some fruit in the center--plum, mostly--with cedar and spice notes in the smooth finish. Not a bold cab, but very drinkable. Soft, oh so soft. Very fruity/juicy and no tannin, no structure. But easily quaffable by itself, no need to age. Cab, Merlot, PV. 18% new oak. $17. A little hot, but it's a bit too warmed. Cedar and plummy, cassis aromas and flavors. Pure, cassis fruit and tobacco on the midpalate. Exceptionally good for the price. Wish we'd purchased more. I t is a good Cab and at BB prices it is a great cab\n",

Both tart and sweet on the palate with more red fruit flavors. Great QPR. Would purchase again. Full of ripe red fruit flavors--raspberry, cherry, plum. The nose had a sweet flavor; it reminded me of red twizzlers or cotton candy.

Good structure here with good acid, complexity and integrated soft tannin. Silkier earth flavors and a bit chewy with more background red fruit but even greater length of wild brambly earth and red fruits. Quite balanced and long.

      "I had this bottle at the Epic Roasthouse in San Francisco. This was my third meal of a Napa/San Fran trip and the theme of the restuarnts that I went to was serving the wine way to warm. Unfortunately this wine was served luke warm. The restaurant provided very nice Schott Sweisel stemware but must be keeping thier wine in the kitchen. I think the wine may have been better than my notes but to me this wine seemed a bit green and a bit too oaky. The acid seemed a bit out of wack with the fruit component, which I did like although it had an artichoke component. At GlassHalfull. On opening quite closed but with real rich black fruit. Began to open up fairly quickly adding gamey notes, spice and a bit of eucalyptus. Some tarry, burnt and earthy flavors. Some tannin and the alcohol shows through just the littlest bit. Love this wine, partially because it's such a nice change of pace from heavy, syrupy, and oaky syrahs I've been drinking lately. Focused nose of violet, blackberry, strawberry, meat, forest floor, and pepper. Tart cherry and blackberry on the palate. Lots of juicy acidity -- kind of minerally and chalky. Terrific mouthfeel, spicy, full, but light. It's one of those wines that you just keep sipping until you've realized you're on your fourth glass. True story. Will hold next bottle for awhile to resolve some of the tannins. 90-91 This bottle is deeper and darker than the first one. Some of the freshness is gone but it's still very food friendly. Cherry, meat, violets, lilac, pepper, blackberry, herbs, incense, and a little lavender on the nose. Tart and sweet cherry, black cherry, pepper, flowers, blackberry, and herbs on the palate. Bright acidity. I love how the flowers (violets, lilacs) pick up in the mid palate. Nice finish. Went surprisingly well with a taco salad with black olives. Delicious. 91-92 Dark cherry red color; roasted plum, light berry, olive nose; roasted plum, light pepper, olive palate; medium-plus finish (Durrell clone, with 3% Viognier) Drank at Christmas dinner at the club, had a kind of funky nose, but opened up on the palate. Decent bottle of wine, don't know if I'd pony up the sticker price though... Poured into decanter and started drinking immediately (just try and stop me, wifey!), but drank over the course of the evening.<br /><br />Leather, horse manure, funk, brined olives, and topsoil on the nose.<br />Flavor is similar to taking a giant spoonful of raspberry and black cherry jam and spreading it over a steak au poive. Deep umami mouthfeel..almost soysauce or mushrooms... long finish..balance is spectacular..this is a 13 year old Chinese gymnast at the Olympics.<br /><br />If guy fieri and the maitre d' from Daniel NYC were both bitten by the same radioactive spider and also gained suits of iron and fought evil and also served wine, this would be said wine. Explosive flavor (Guy's \"flavortown\") meets old world sophistication, depth, and class (Daniel NYC). <br /><br />I hate Guy Fieri, but that hair and all of the bracelets and everything. I mean that guy must know fine wine and food, right? Who could go wrong serving \"Donkey sauce\" to friends? But then I go to a place I see on the show by coincidence and alas, I too want to go and buy and 67 SS Camaro and drive it places and spike my hair and talk funny and perpetually wear sunglasses backwards on my head WTF? and stick my fat porcine fingers into the stockpots of innumerable diner waitresses. <br /><br />Likewise, who wants to be the stuck-up, know-it-all, old guard of a maitre d' at Daniel? But then you see the way that he gracefully moves from table to table..a joke here, a smile, noting the gentlemen when needed but never forgetting the ladies. Always, always paying attention to the ladies. And you see the way that these older upper east siders look at him with suspicion and wonder and awe and desire.<br /><br />Moral of the story is that guy and mr maitre d are two of the worlds greatest poonhounds and this wine is too. Pour this wine on your next date. If you dont succeed...you're doing it wrong.<br /><br />Music Medium garnet ruby color. A little cloudy. Nose of fresh raspberries and leather. Palate is red-fruited with an animal funk reminiscent of Beaucastel (in a good way). Finishes with black pepper and a mouth-watering acidity. My wife thought for sure this was French. I'll agree except in that she did not mean it as a compliment! Very nice bottle of wine, drinking well right now.\n",

      "This wine was an education for us in many ways. First off, it was our first Claret (but definitely not our last). Second, it was an education in sediment.<br />As for the wine itself, we really enjoyed it. When I first unscrewed the cap, there was a strong and pleasant scent of dark chocolate and cherries. Yum. Later, after the wine had been open for a couple of hours, we also detected a peppery scent overtaking the chocolate.<br />The color was pure garnet and was the only thing about this wine that didn't change over time.<br />When I first tasted the wine and began enjoying the glass, it was before dinner. I tasted a lot of cherry and chocolate, and was pleasantly surprised. I popped a Ghiradelli raspberry chocolate square and the wine only got better. For dinner, we ended up having a citrus pork dish, and the wine did not accent the meal at all. We switched to water. By the time we got back to the wine, the chocolate had receded and we were tasting a lot of pepper. I'm generally turned off by peppery wines, unlike Kev in, but this was softer and I didn't really mind it. By the second night (after properly storing the bottle), we were back to chocolate, but softer, and a little less on the cherry, with very very small amounts of pepper. <br />Interestingly, at the end of the bottle, in our glasses, was a large amount of sediment. We'd never encountered such a large amount of sediment before and I had to do a little research to reassure myself that it was all okay. I can only assume this was an unfiltered wine. Next time, we'll decant first.<br />Overall, we really enjoyed the Claret. It was our first Claret and definitely an interesting introduction. I'll pick up this wine again soon, or at least as soon as we plow through some more of the overwhelming stacks of Reds we have sitting around. ;-) On our own scale of 1-10, we give this an 8.5. Maybe even a 9 for the extra education. Three options with this wine. 1 Decant well, for at least two hours. 2. Open, and leave the wine in the fridge with the stelvin turned back tight for 2-3 days and then drink. 3. Cellar for 2-3 years. Why? Read on. 33% Cabernet Franc, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 15% Syrah, 1% Grenache and 1% Malbec. Day 1 Not bad. Slightly smokey. Had some cherry, but mostly black fruit and tobacco, etc... Actually, mdstenner's notes are right on. Mine was left in the trunk, so it was technically a little cooked, but it didn't show in the wine. Given that, I'd rate it 83 pts. Light, fruity and balanced, this makes an excellent food wine with fish and chicken. The nose had black currant and plum, mixed with chocolate, nutmeg, and a touch of oak. The palate had raspberry and spice, along with oak and plum. The finish was good. Nice bottle of wine for the money ($12.00)<br />Nice spicey nose with dark fruit forward taste that transitions into a spicey peppery dark complex fruit finish. Yums! Bought two on a whim at Whole Foods, then drank one at the Kahn family dinner. Lives up to its label as dark and complex. Hard to pin down what went into it, but I'll guess a lot of mourvedre and cab franc. Very thick, long finish, on par with a $20 Bordeaux. Drank with Steve, Amy and grandfolks to accompany a lamb roast. Gentle, oaky, with a full, long lasting flavor that paired well with the meal. Everyone's favorite... wish I had a few more bottles. Sweet dark fruit on the nose, lots of toasty oak. Medium body, not a complex wine but not too simple either. Solid and approachable. Good balance. Drank with Dev while watching a movie. Pretty good, but my least favorite offering by Ato Z thus far. Terriffic nose but found it a bit over-oaked and the finish was a bit unbalanced. Other users gave a 15% Syrah percentage; I would have guessed much higher. Not bad and probably would have shown better with food, but probably not really worth trying again when there is so much else out there at this price range.\n",

Full deep purplish garnet color which could have belonged to an '02. Very open nose of deep, dark fruit, violets, wax polish and forest floor. Texture is soft and silky with well-integrated tannins but sucking in a little air with it unleashes bold cherry fruit flavors and real power of those flavors. Real gravitas with wonderful length. Great showing for a 15 yr old 1er cru wine. Could have passd for a GC without skipping a beat! Very fresh black cherry fruits mixed with sous bois notes and a faint note of coffee. Good balance on the palate with medium to medium+ body flavors of red and black cherry fruits that lead to a spicy midpalate and finish.

Super soft and rounded with loads of dark fruits and gamey notes. A very balanced wine. Nose is perhaps a bit hotter than the finish. Lots of red fruit on the mid palate with rounded juicy tannins appearing on the finish. A good bottle for the price point. We plan to drink up as this one is not likely to be much better tomorrow. Another beautifully balanced bottle of wine, great mouthfeel and nose. Another one that meets the criteria \"wish we had more of that\". Certainly has not turned the corner yet. Overwhelmed by funk/barnyard/mushroom, eeesh. This was a great Claret that held up well over two nights. Cassis, dark fruits and coffee. On the second night just a touch of prune snuck in. Fine, well integrated tannins. Soft on the nose, with remarkable silky texture, densely purple hue. Juicy berry pie, notes of spice, medium finish. Highly drinkable now. Rich dark fruit nose, sun-dried tomato, dark chocolate and cedar. Some hints of old leaves in there too. Smells pretty good. Medium-to-full bodied. Ripe berry flavors, some plum fruit, dark chocloate, great acidity, relaxed, late-hitting tannin. Decently balanced, with a relaxed approach that doesn't overpower your meal. Fantastic with my ribeye steak. Barely showing age, but still rather primary. Drinking well now but will get more interesting as time goes on. 89+\n",

      "Sorry to be simplistic, but this was just good stuff. Day two when fully opened was a bit barnyardy, but otherwise cherry candy---a lip smacker! dark garnet color; spice, black cherry, and some underbrush on the nose. Serious extraction, as always from this producer---WAIT! I strongly expect this to improve... Drank over two nights. First night was very good - dark berry, pepper & spice. Pretty tannic but not overwhelming. It did not hold up for the second night at all. It tasted like something that tastes a little like red wine. A great red wine for everyday. A pleasing, simple Grenache that exudes primary characteristics of cherry and strawberry to the nose and plum and licorice to the mouth. It's nicely balanced, with good acidity, and provides touches of spice and sweetness in equal measure. A bit simple and lacks depth. Poor QPR  better quality Rhône and Spanish Garnacha is available for half the price. Bing Cherry flavors dominate this food friendly wine.\n",

A $90 Tempranillo from Oregon?! That would qualify as odd, I'd say... Opened but no decant for 6 hours, it's essentially the same as my last note. Black cherry, some raspberry, leather, tar, and tannins and then some more tannins! It would still be fun to have one in 2015. After a \"Vinturi decant\" for an hour, this wine appears to be miles from plateau. The color is a deep, dark garnet w/ purple tinges. The nose is moderate and somewhere between a young port and Ribera. The palate is all about deep black fruit and leather. You're sitting there trying to appreciate and name some of the nuances and then the tannins give your palate a kick and say \"sorry, wait a decade!\". About 180 cases produced and it's a non-friendly price point so where do you go? I'll save my second (and last) for a 2005 Bordeaux tasting to be held in 2015 (it'll be a ringer in a blind flight and given the tannin level similarity to the '05 Bordeaux, it MIGHT be a challenge). It reminds me a bit of their 1998 Tempranillo which was perhaps one of the most tannic (non-Tannat) wines I've ever had. Deep, rich, tight wine. Let age several years.\n",

      "Still a dark near purple color, it has a nice mix of black fruit and earth tones. As good the next day. Double decanted for 1 hour. Nose is ripe blackberries, tobacco, earth and slight herbal note, possibly basil. On the palate immediately sweet strawberries, tart blackberries leading into a somewhat hollow mid-palate then a wash of tobacco, earth and tannin. The acid and tannin on the end linger for 30 seconds at least and are pleasant. Overall the wine is somewhat off-balance. I would say it is not ready to drink, I would think age would help smooth the tannin and acid and help the flavors integrate. The wine did pair nicely with a medium-rare lamb chop and asparagus. First bottle ever of this wine. At first I was somewhat disappointed. <br />For a new world syrah, it was tight, ungiving, showed nothing on either the nose or palate. So, put in decanter, come back an hour later, and, voila - it had blossomed. Excellent value, and probably has a long life ahead of it. Very cote-rotie-like. For $45 this should be on par with some of the best syrahs in the PNW. Unfortunately, it was not. Bright red and black fruit, baking spices, hint of bacon. I did not get a lot of acidy or structure from this. It seemed one-dimensional to me and lacked minerality. It was smooth drinking, but felt over extracted and missing that je ne sais quoi for the upper end of their portfolio. Tasted at the new tasting room. Deep ruby red in color with good concentration of fruit. Very well balanced wine. This wine is drinking well now. Given a small amount of time this wine opens up even more.

The liquorous, sweet and over-ripe fruit vies with the oak for dominance. Sweet, concentrated, liquorous, oaky, plump, confected but with good acidity.

A clear varietal nose with notes of menthol, olives, wood and smoked meat complementing the baked red and dark fruit.<br />Fullbodied and concentrated on the palate with actually pretty adequate structure to back up the ripe darkish fruit. Menthol, medicinal notes, olives, dark chocolate, liquorice and chewy meatiness. Lengthy.<br />Surprisingly pleasent! This would make for a really nice Barossa Shiraz, but it isn't half bad even as a modern Languedoc wine. Popped and poured, allowed to open up in the glass for some 20 mins. This is a lively garnet red with a violet hue to it. The nose is quite oak dominated, bacon and blood, but bright red fruits are coming through as well. The palate has a bitter grapefruit aspect to the otherwise strong fruit, with some tannins, and leaving a very nice finish of bright red fruits. This is somewhat of a power wine, but with a bit of elegance coming in, it might well calm down into very nice wine. Very good now as well. Carcassonne\n",

      "Mainly used this for cooking but it drank pretty well for a ten dollar vacqueras. Ruby red with a light nose of cherry and alcohol. On the palate there is earth and cherries with firm tannins and a short finish. This is simple and straight forward but is pleasureable and gives good quality for the price. Heritage Rhone blend, mostly syrah -- but bigger riper fruit than typical of the region -- reminiscent of a bordeaux blend. Some sour cherry on the nose and a streak of thyme on the palette. Very good wine for the price. Definitely Rhone, although not necessarily like other Vacqueyras I've had. Darker sweeter fruits, pencil shavings, some tobacco. Tastes a little bit like a Chateauneuf-du-pape instead of say Sang des Cailloux. The tannins have resolved nicely. A steal for $12. I wish I had some more. A Grape Expectations import. @ Purple Cafe, Woodinville WA.<br />Medium red colour, opaque with a decent nose. A little rough on the palate since it's quite young - the tannins are quite potent but not overpowering. Quite well-extracted and almost new-world in flavor, lots of black berries, blackcurrants, cherries without any sweetness. Well balanced and smooth going down. The dark fruit is pretty overwhelmed by pepper. Thin mouthfeel. Not a bad wine for price, but not a repeat purchase for me. This wine was ruby/purple in color, dense and clear with signs of glycerol. Nots of white pepper, black cherry, black currant and earth on the nose. Plenty of acidity with drying tannins and a bitter aftertaste. I've had wine from this producer before and liked it. This might be a bad bottle, but there's an overwhelming diaper poo on the nose and palate. It's not brett. Also, this seems riper and more new world than prior wine I've had from this producer. The quality seems more like a Cotes du Rhone. It was priced like a Cotes du Rhone, so I guess the value was there. Just not as good as before. A Grape Expectations import. This is a decent grenache from France. Pretty easy drinking and a good value\n",

      "Not much fruit or flavor, tasted old vine but without depth. Didn't open up even after a few hours. Not bad, just not good. Tasted side by side with 2000 Margaux Pavillion Rouge and 2001 Caro bordeaux style blends. This was the most rich and aromatic of the group. Dark purple, sweet merlot influenced, blend with long smooth finish. Clearly California style. Would happily drink again, but it was the only bottle of this gem in my cellar and I don't remember how it got there. Very good Still impressive. Tannins very mild. This wine did not change much in 18 months. Absolutely YUMMY! This wine was very smooth with hints of chocolate on the finish. Mild tannins. We opened this bottle to taste prior to a steak dinner and had none left at mealtime. So glad I have another bottle......can't wait to taste next year. I had this wine this summer and loved it. I don't remember what I paid for it, but dont think it was too much. Got alot of fruit and spice wich we really like. I thinks its a zin based wine. Have two more bottles and will drink again next year A nice sipper. Solid aromas that started to tantalize me from 3' away; getting your nose in the glass confirms a nice blend of dark fruit and licorice. Smooth on the palate with few tannins, the fruit and licorice continue in the mount with a little alchohol zing and medium smooth mouthfeel This is a nice wine for sipping in the late evening while surfing wine sites online! very jammy with the classic chocaltey richness of Paso wines FINE's wine Value tasting - Easy drinking smooth tannins Easy drink.

Impressive shelf life for a jammy style zin. ($12) Translucent with a clear rim. Slightly cloudy. Nose of strawberry and cranberry and balsam? Along with a little spice. Too much alcohol for the level of fruit perhaps, but not flawed. Nice price, but I think it was a \"clearance\" thing. ($12) Gorgeous blueberry fruit nose - very exuberant. Ripe palate with initial sweetness and blueberry fruit just like the nose. The wine quickly loses cohesion and fades away though. I didn't pick up many secondary flavors, maybe some earth, but I was eating Indian at the time. Fun, inexpensive, short, but great nose. I love blueberry in wine.

Full of black cherry and oak, with lingering hints of pepper, clove and chocolate. Really reflects the terroir of this vineyard - delightful with grilled salmon.

      "Rich, dark reddish purple in color. Nose of ripe black fruit...blackberries, stewey dark plum, and a little bit of a greenish, vegetal component. Palate of big, dark fruit, as well, with that stewey character which was present on the nose. Also, green pepper, vegetal quality, and a mineral quality, reminiscent of petrol/kerosene. Tannins have faded, if they were ever significant...they're soft and round now. The fruit carries on for a fairly long, pleasant finish. Overall impression would be more favorable without that petrol quality, but still mostly pleasant. Dark purple in color. Big wine. Needs to open up. Will be even better in 5 years.

      "Served at Al Gordon's with Saturday Group. Decanted for about 3 hours. Nice rich nose. Good attack. Not tannic. But here's the rub Limited notes, from memory dark purple; smoky red to blue fruits with touch leather and black tea; dusty more slight chocolate and mint thinning out a bit on the finish. nice mature tasting cali styled bordeaux blend. dark red, beautiful mature nose of cherry, tobacco and cedar; medium bodied elegant seamless wine with nice finish. really really nice and significantly better than last bottle. lots of sediment. Not the best offering from Achaval, given that thier wines didn't really come to form until the '02 vintage. Otherwise, the wine is reminscent of the latest style Quimera blend that they currently bottle. For the price, well worth the effort. Not that impressed. Preferred it upon immediately opening. Definitely has a bit of a S.American flavor profile (e.g. subtle eucalyptis), easily could have confused for a Chilean, despite the malbec. Lots of sentiment at end. Leather and eucalyptus on the nose immediately after opened. Decanted. An hour later, still a bit of leather, but the eucalyptus had faded (still there, but weak). Flavors of tart red cherry -- really not a terribly complex flavor profile. A long finish now, and good mouthfeel - though a bit tannic on the tongue, unclear if this needs to open even further or if there was a bit too much sediment. Ready to drink and we don't think it will improve with age, but we think this could last a bit longer if desired.\n",

      "This wine has a lot more potential than my score, but I wonder if it will achieve its potential. A large-scale efforts with even larger structure (tannins and acidity). It's a very high-altitude wine, so the acidity is not a big surprise, but it's near impenetrability is. This wine a a fair amount of sentiment, which I screened out on the way to the decanter. Even after 8+hours of decanting, it's still pretty stiff and needs more time. Regardless, it has good dark fruit flavors and solid depth of fruit. We'll see it it achieves its potential in a few years. Opaque deep purple appearance. Delivering mixed black fruits, ripe plums, graphite, spices, toast, floral and subtle hints of mint leaf. This is full-bodied and very well structured, developing a beautiful fresh character after some exposure to air. The finish is mouth-coating and very long. There is no rush on this, it still could use a bit of time and your patience will be rewarded. The final blend is composed of 40% Malbec, 22% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, and 4% Petit Verdot (Drink 2014-2023) Dark garnet color with violet overtones and spicy dark fruit, pencil lead,and violet aromas.

      "Delicious nose. Really incredible. Cherry and strawberry and ripe rich luscious red fruits, along with pumpkin spice mix, mint and dust/chalk. THe nose even became darker over time, with more intense, dark fruit aromas. The palate was lighter in mouthfeel than the nose promised. Smooth tannins, chalky, dusty finish of sour cherry. Not a particularly long finish, either. More weight to the mouthfeel and a longer finish would make this a stellar bottle. LOTS OF SEDIMENT. NEED TO DECANT NEXT TIME. decanted about 2-3 hours prior to drinking<br />nose Beautiful nose of plums, cherries and a floral overtones. In the palate ripe cherries, minerals, and lively acidity, but excruciatingly firm and tannic at this stage and in need of many more years of bottle age.\n",

      "Did not rate this time, but this is a greater than 90 point wine. Very big and young so will need some time in the bottle to round out. Nose with sweet bright fruit both red and black along with some mocha and oak. Palate is full but a bit tannic and slightly askew on the hind palate which I think is related to youth. I have a hard time giving this wine more than 90. I was very optimistic upon opening. I had heard good things from people I trust on this and found the nose very nice with lots of fruit and some floral, almost some candy on the nose as well. The problem I found was that the palate didn't match the nose, it had a tannic front month feel but a short abrupt finish. I found the lack of a finish very disappointing. On day two after corking the remainder of the bottle(I had decanted for a few hours on day one and poured the remainder back into the bottle) I found the nose to be much more muted and the palate more restrained, still drinkable but still a very abrupt and slight finish. At this price, I expect more. good-ageable, classic, opulant, gripping, and seductive according to my friends Very dark fruit. Tart cherry entry but opened up after 45 minutes. to show vanilla, blackberry and some cherry but the blackberry dominated. Chewy finish with some cocoa.\n",

Big red with lots of fruit up front. Still has much to show with additional time Still like this one. Dried fruit and meaty mixed with earthiness. A good wine - earth, some dried fruit, long finish. Really nicely done. Straight up dark cherries on the nose here. Some nice fruit shows up on the mid palate, but the wine is a bit disjointed toward the finish. A great job by a boutique Washington Winery. Deep earth and juice flows... Really enjoyed this wine. Tasted at the winery a few months ago and it was as good as we remember. Not on the the level of Trust Syrah in terms of Washington Syrahs, but suprisingly good. Nose of Dark Cherry, Blueberry, & Cranberry spiced jam with hints of savory herbs/slight anise. Still slightly young, showing good tannin structure for a syrah. Slightly leaner style of syrah than the full plush style. Quite nice. Max body, but with the typical Walla Walla nose, elegant and supple. Quite gorgeous and well worth the price point. Lots of fruit and could even use a few years in the cellar.\n",

Will age well. Dark berry and tannins. Daniel's Bellevue w MS Drank at Russell's in Bothell along with other wines. This one stood out as top notch Cab with ample backbone, laser focused fruit and precision. Remainder on Sunday still had all the stuffing. Fabulous wine. Beautiful fragrant nose that opens up with lavender, cocoa, baking spices. Mouthfeel proves it's non-filtered wine. Tannins are well integrated and long smooth finish. This wine came a long way in a year since I last tasted. It is now integrated and in balance though still quite young. The nose is beautiful though still a bit alcoholic, but with the smell of chocolate, black fruit and earth. In the mouth, the wine is singing. I have never experienced a wine with so much unsweetened chocolate flavor balanced with deep, ripe blackberries. A real beauty. Now if I can just force myself to wait a couple of years for the next one. While I am certain that this wine will be glorious in its old age, I am equally as certain it will not survive that long. This wine is very, very young but has enormous potential. A menthol and wet earth nose. The wine is dense and powerful - packed with black fruit and espresso flavors, with a tiny hint of chocolate on the finish. It tastes high in alcohol - 14.9% but tastes higher. It's not yet entirely integrated but it seems as if all the components are there for a gorgeous future - 5 years away yet. Very nice, smooth cab. A very nice smooth cab with good fruit and body. Friends and I tasted this at the winery on 7/28/12. It had a deep, dense, layered and smoky bouquet of violet, black currant, leather, cocoa, herb and spice aromas.

      "100% Cab all from one of the oldest vineyards in WA, Red Willow in Yakima Valley. A spectacular nose on this wine - vanilla, cardamom, perfume, Crème Brule, tobacco, and fig. An array of flavors with this wine including currant, pepper, fig and date. A very well balanced wine, with an excellent tannin structure that will make it a great keeper for a few years. Let open over two hours while Christmas dinner prepared. Once opened up fantastic aromas of plums, cassis, dark cherries, and spice. Cardomom maybe cinnamon, vanilla, caramel after sitting longer. Palate is full and silky with delicate notes too. Amazing mouthfeel unlike anything else I've ever tasted. End is long with plenty of tannins that will sustain this wine for a long time. My last tasting note on this wine was a yeqr and a half ago. I have confirmed the wine is a baby and I must learn restraint. Beautiful nose of cedar and cigar box. Sweet black fruit. So much cigar tobacco, not smoke, on the nose. Fantastically masculine and powerful. Still tannic and muscular though I decanted it a full ten hours before I even started drinking it. The fruit from a year ago seems to be expresing its recessive gene, if that is possible, and the flavors are all oak and tannin and leather. Cassis, but tannic, grippy cassis. I vow to wait on this wine until 2015. Maybe 2013, just to check. This is really quite a remarkable wine. First thing - this wine is at least 3 years away and is likely to be at its best in 10? 15? It is, simply put, an extraordinary wine, providing only glimpses now. I decanted it for four hours before drinking and it needed it. Over the course of two hours in the glass, it developed even more. On the nose, black plum, herbs, minerals and, as the wine developed, violets. The nose had prominent vanilla and the vanilla reappeared, later on, on the finish. In the mouth, the wine is peppery, black plum/black cherry and on the finish cassis - or at least, concentrated blackberry. The minerals also reappeared. The wine has a luxurious mouth feel. Right now it's highly tannic, but the tannins carry the structure and contribute to the remarkable and long (at least 30 seconds) finish. This is an amazing wine - perhaps not Quilceda Creek, as it doesn't have quite the concentration - but it's a third the price! A remarkable achievement. I am feeling very smart about my decision to buy a case based on a barrel sample. inky black in the glass with a slight reddish hue. the nose is massive, with thick blackberries, black cherries, mocha, and just a tinge of heat. so ripe and fruit-forward in the mouth, but layered, dense and complex at the same time. the finish lasts a good 35 seconds and unfolds with new oak, dense black fruits, and amazingly-concentrated wa cab sauv flavors. this is an outstanding wine. Color is dense burgundy. Nose is an amazing velvety fruit , cassis and cherry, with caramel, perfume, sweet cigar and eventual notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. My wife contends she could live inside a glass of this wine until she dies. Mouthfeel is full with same flavors firm tannins and finish lasting a long long time. Rated the '07 at 95 points and this one is better, a new benchmark. Nothing else like it in our cellar and I'm glad to have gotten an allocation pre-release. This will be gone immediately on release.<br /><br />Our Anniversary Dinner wine. Consistent with prior note. Drank with family side by side with 08 Rasa Creative Impulse and 08 JB Neufeld Artz. This was my wine of the night, such a lush gorgeous wine. Wow. Gorgeous aromatics of damp earth, smoke, cigar box and cassis. Hint of vanilla. Impressive depth of flavor with only one discordant note of aggressive acidity, even after 7 hours in decanter. Remarkable wine, but patience is a virtue.\n",

      "Young, fruit-forward but lush and very well integrated. A delicious wine. This bottle didn't need a whole lot of decanting and I noticed it was beginning to develop a little bacon fat and cheese on the nose after sitting for about 30 mins. The taste came across as somewhat minerallic with chocolate and ripe black cherries on the palate, followed quickly by some late heat on the finish. <br /><br />While this is an excellent wine that may still be a little on the young side, it comes across as approachable now and paired perfectly tonight with some filet mignon Huge dense nose of red and black fruits, barrel toast and herbs. Palate is forward, rich and chewy. Very much still a baby with primary fruits that coat the mouth. Suave tannins provide grip. A healthy dose of oak complements the rich, creamy fruit. Really like the leafy, tobacco note imparted by the Cab Franc. Needs a couple years to integrate in bottle. Has potential but way too hot. Decanted 90 minutes but still not long enough. 2 years from now will be a 90. Still young and tightly wound on opening. After an hour start to opened up with gorgeous velvety texture and soft deep fruit with multiple layers. Give a couple of hours at least and this wine sings. wow! fruitforward, very smooth, great mouth feel. Unbelievabvle with chocolate! the nose on this was very promising, with creosote, clay dust, hot bricks, and sweet if high-toned cherries. but the mouth was tight as a drum, with tannins that really shut everything down for me and kept the finish from doing anything interesting. the finish was a little bitter and unripe, which was strange since the nose didn't suggest any unripeness. Opened on a Friday early evening - the wine is tight, tannic and unapproachable. I left it decanted overnight in the cellar and drank it 26 hours later. The lengthy decanting provided a glimpse of the future - and what a brilliant future this wine has. Powerful aromas of asphalt, black licorice and flowers. Remarkable concentration with black fruit, tobacco and tar in the mouth. Grippy tannins on the lingering finish. My remaining bottles will be stashed in the corner for a few years. Friends and I tasted this at the winery on 7/28/12. It had a deep, fragrant and smoky bouquet of black currant, cocoa, tobacco, herb and spice aromas. The palate was rich and powerful with flavors that followed the nose. 91+ Yes. Opened this bottle and enjoyed the first half on day one. Letting it open up overnight and expecting even more tomorrow.

COTA Fairhope dinner Just as per the other entries...this is a well-made and nicely aged Shiraz, balanced and a beaut...tannins fully resolved, but plenty of fruit left...marvelous. We can only hope that the bevy of other Ozzies age as gracefully... Textbook oz Shiraz, abundant black fruit, warm spice, integrated tannin and long finish. Delicious, fully mature but several years ahead. Even better the next day - upgraded by one point. Aromatic and mellow, pretty much consistent with my previous note last year. This venerable shiraz is definitely aging gracefully. Inky black with a slight orange tinge. Spicy nose with nuances of pepper, cumin and menthol. The palate is medium full, smooth and slightly dry with the fruit core still intact. Very different from the typical S. Australian shiraz. Drinking beautifully now but still has the goods to last for another five years or so. Drinking very nicely. Tannins have disappeared. Smooth and spicy with plenty of fruit. The best bottle yet. A bit angular and disconnected initially. After a couple of days this opened out into absolutely delicious shiraz with a remarkable \"cool purity\" on the palate. Suggests this wine still has a long way to go if you're prepared to wait. Deep, intense berry, oak and fruit notes with a hint of sharpness. This can wait another couple of years and will only get better!\n",

      "Showing a clean color and a hint of evolution in the rim, the wine has a very attractive and complex nose. Cherries, Brown spice, a hint of leather and a floral undertone make it very appealing. In the mouth it is well structured with a good level of tannin and acidity and an extremely long finish on those floral undertones. Fantastic and very refined. This estate is located in the town of Bevagna. Oak and bottle aging for 3 years. A DOCG wine made from 100% Sagrantino grapes which are native to and only grown in Umbria. I was impressed by this wine and I think Eno liked it slightly better than I did. It was a deep red color. Firm tannins which lead me to conclude that my remaining bottle will sit until about 2009 to let the tannins settle. Not overly concentrated. Nice balance between the fruit and wood. This wine presented a similar profile as an upper level Sangiovese based wine. Cherry and cassis notes. Medium to full bodied. 91 points. outstanding deep and complex earthy tones are picked up very nice finish not too hot Pure deep garnet with a tiny bit of evolution apparent. Nose is a bit reticent but deep and complex with squash, earth, sweet red fruits and preserves, blood and iodine, some sweet / yeasty notes like pastry and fall spices. Copious but not harsh (though not sweet and too fine grained either) tannins and bracing acidity on the palate support a huge wall of red fruit dominated by red cherries and currants. Some molasses and baking spices in there perhaps as well. Beautiful rusticity comes through with leather, earth and a mild dose of good old farmy funk... finishes long and simultaneously mouth puckering and sweet with tannin, cherry preserves and zippy acidity that aren't quite integrated. This is, like many sagrantinos, hard to pin down but utterly engaging with huge depth and massive structure. A very big wine at 14% abv, this is a rocking experience now but in 3+ years should be sublime. Tannins are largely resolved. Soft and warm and inviting. Red fruits, spices, turned earth and a noticable but not offputting barnyard character. Elegant and integrated palate with a twinge of metallic / shrill metallic brett character that is ever so slightly offputting. Moderate finish. Drinking well now, very enjoyable to me, but to those very brett averse could be offputting. Deep dark color, wonderful subtle earthy nose. elegant, complex, moderate tannins, long finish. still had life. Not as interesting as some Sagrantinos. This one was fairly rustic with rough tannins that may outlive the fruit. There were nice underbrush and licorice notes, as well as good concentration though. I think I opened this one at the right time. The nose on this wine offers dark berries, chocolate, plums, and above all else, MEAT! The flavors of the wine have the same trajectory as the nose On the nose bright red fruit, leather, warm earth, a bit of spice, a hint of toast. Tannic and reasonably primary with perfectly bright but not obtrusive acidity. Clenchingly long finish. Give this 3-4 years and be happy. A tremendous QPR at $27. 90+ now, but if it performs as well or better than the 99 (which I anticipate) it has a LOT of upside. I love it. Hard to describe Nice sagrantino, young at 10 years old, with that dark sagrantino funk, roasted meat and a hint of wild herbs. This has a lot of the good qualitys I like in a sagrantino.

      "(Blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah) - Chocolate and berry nose; tart berry, with good acidity; medium finish (great value at $15 suggested retail) great red wine, it held its own the next day for a finish of the bottle. Bold, yet smooth and went very well with a spicy dish. This bold red wine is great with comfort food. We usually serve it with chili and bread. It is well structured with bold body Black fruit, blue fruit, menthol nose; black fruit, blue fruit, menthol palate; medium finish (43% Syrah, 39% Zinfandel, 13% Petite Sirah, 4% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot) A big, yummy, smooth red blend of 43% Syrah, 39% Zinfandel, 13% Petite Sirah, 4% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot. Abundant notes of dark chocolate, plum, and black cherry are echoed in the flavors. Goes down VERY easily, so remember it's 15% ABV. For those who like a big, bold red to go with beef stews, burgers, and even spaghetti and meatballs. Dark red violet color; baked black fruit, berry nose; baked black fruit, berry palate; medium-plus finish (55% Dolcetto, 33% Zinfandel, 12% Syrah)\n",

      "Deep garnet color. Lots of dark fruit and bright acidity over smooth tannins. Not likely getting any better; probably can easily last another 2-3 years. Soft nose of red berries. Tart berries with a bit of a bite. Not a deep dark Cab but friendly for early easy drinking. <br />\n"
