      "Centroid 1's Closest Sentence is \"Little more green this time around. It's much better with food than on its own. Amazing value at $10. Beautiful fruit with a touch of minerality and chalkiness. This went amazingly well with pizza but also drank well on its own. This is exactly what I'm looking for in a $10 import. Over delivers in my opinion. This is a decent Portugese red that shows currant and blackberry aromas. The palate has smooth tannins and juicy black fruit. It's very easy to drink, just not that complex. But it's great for $12. Medicinal aromas of cherry cough syrup. Bright red raspberry flavors throughout. Fruit is a little candied and ripe. Better than most $10 wines. Tastes cheap. Second bottle in a row with consistent results. Heck of a bottle of wine, particularly for the money. Would jump on buying more if I can find it. - Brick color with slow forming legs with a full body. Round texture with a medium finish - Much better than expected. Drank over a two hour period of time. Worth a lot more than the 10 bucks paid for this bottle. Had a lot of $20+ a bottles that were close to this Duoro. Drank this Head2Head with a 2008 Michele Chiarlo Barbera d'Asti Superiore Le Orme and the Tons won. Both are good week night wines at this price point, but nothing special. Won't buy the barbera again. Would purchase the Tons in a pinch, but feel there's better wines to be had even at this price point Heavy, boring, worse on Day 2. Not sure what WS was drinking. Dry with clean fruit palate. Opens up nicely over course of evening. Good value for $10 wine Disappointing, some black fruits and spice but thin, no finish at all. Only $11 so can't complain too much but will give the rest away or use to cook with. Drank with Joe Ragno and Stef Blackberries with leather and blueberry tones, a black pepper streak adds depth. Big body, Tannins are big and provide a good backbone for the dense flavors. Nice layering with the fruit and secondary flavors. Finish is nicely complex and lingering. Very balanced. Well rounded Przyjemna portugalia, mocno cielista bez kwasowo&#347;ci. Consistent with previous note. Disappointing even at the price. Proof not to buy on score alone. Not sure what WS was tasting here. PnvnD let air for 4 hrs. - way too much effort for what is generously a modest wine. Dark crimson purple not saturated with a clear rim. Fake fruit cherry nibs candy aroma. Medium(-) weight with no structure or mid-palate. Fake candied beaujolais noveau flavors. Short finish and no complexity. Despite the price was expecting way more given the WS review and the appellation. May return the second of the two bottles I purchased.\"\n",

Oh my, the flavor is huge, coats all sides of the tongue with flavor, thick and chewy, big blackberry with cherry that pulls through and says I'm here too. There's a slight pepper that slides in under the thick berry. This is an unbelievable tasting wine. I am amazed and in love! Ok here's the blending Unusual blend of about 13 grape varieties. Beautiful color, nice nose, some earthy quality, subtle berry flavors. Big almost jammy flavor, still shows tannins. Decant or wait awhile longer to drink. Subtle finish, though I wish it was a bit longer. All in all I like the wine and the label and grape blend make for conversation. Inky violet color with dark fruit, slightly earthy, and spicy aromas. On the palate it's big, and full-bodied with intense, ripe blackberry, blueberry, plum and vanilla spice flavors. Medium finish.

Some mint aromas ond soft red fruit flavors. Spicy complex nose, tannin very drying at present, one to age, very nice finish. Corked! Opened at Allreds house for 48 hours. 2nd time I have had this. Closed now and not as good as when it was first released. Medium bodied with some burnt cherry notes. 89+ points. An elegant and soft texture in this wine. Ripe fruit and mocha notes. 91+ points. w venison stew on cold sunday. great deep red color, somewhat subdued node but excellent fruit and balance on the palate. perfect to drink but can/will live for plenty more yrs. excellent combination. venison wants bordeaux (although recipe said Cote Rotie With smoked duck. Open and pour. Color dark red and still young. Subdued nose, but certainly bordeaux some fruit. On the palate very balanced, just very nice with tannins, fruit integrated. Good finish. Not super wine but very good. Will live for a good number of years 5+ at least. Nice balance and well rounded. Nose of spicy oak and dark berries. Medium body with a decent aftertaste. A bit high in acidity but enjoyable with a hearty meal. Drink now-2013. Pretty aromatics of black fruits and mocha. Good grip on the palate with a nice and gentle structure with very sweet tannins. Quite persistent on the finish. Overall a really good showing and much better than a bottle tasted in May at a 2001 horizontal tasting. Tasted April 2005 - Purchased from Sams $26. Great wine - worth keeping. What a really nice bottle of wine. Garnet in color. Cassis and sweet tobacco on the nose. Found this at the store and brought it home and popped and poured. Gave nice sweet fruit and cedar early, then closed down a bit; this was much more open on day 3 when I had the leftovers. Just really enjoyable, smooth, traditional St. Julien, that has developed some nice secondary characteristics. Not as powerful or aromatic as the 03 Lagrange I had recently, but this is better balanced, more ready to drink right now. Lucky I found this at retail; not sure I'd pay $40 again but it was worth it for the learning and enjoyment this time around. Disjointed. Whiff of farmyard, hard to detect any fruit. Woody finish with fruit at the end. Perhaps this was a bad bottle. Decanted for 2+ hours. Nose of dark berries, barnyard and herbs. Palate was dark berries, bitter cherry, roasted herbs and tobacco. Nice acidity makes this a great food wine. Suspected a little heat damage at first since the fruit was more muted than I expected, but it came around after sitting in the glass over the next couple of hours. Plenty of life left. Solid, classic bdx; if you like Bordeaux you will appreciate this wine. Pretty good value if you bought it when released.<br />Nice balance, medium long finish, typical St. Julien flavor profile. Drining well now but should continue to improve a bit--drink or hold for 5 more years. #3 Lagrange, St. Julien<br />First off it had a baby diaper smell that wore off after sitting in the glass for a while. Light cassis flavors, black currants and flowers Full bodied with a long finish and a nice and present tannin structure that signals a long future. Very nice and totally enjoyable right now.<br />93 pt. (My WOTN) Oak forward. Somewhat lacking in the mid palate. Pleasant enough except for the somewhat intrusive oak. Short to medium finish. Not good QPR. Classic Bordeaux... Fantastic barnyard and black cherry aromas lead to a smooth, medium to full bodied palate with dark fruits, earth and cedar. Nice, firm tannins and good finish. One of my personal favourites, always like to return to this bottle, full bodied with an opulent nose of berry fruit, taste well balanced but lots of blackberry and black currant fruits, hits of new oak, long finish with warmness on the tongue. Had tasted 10 bottles over last 3 years, never a dissapointment, even for occasional wine drinkers Barnyard. A lot of spices, clove, coffee. Much cassis juice, good bitterness, leather. Full bodied and firm. The wine has a good future ahead. No hurry. Firm cassis bouquet. There is some development because the wine is not extremely primary anymore, but in fact the wine is a bit locked; even after 5 hours of air. On the palate cassis as well and slightly sticky tannin. For the moment 89, but this wine needs at least another 4 - 5 years of cellaring and then the score will most likely be a few points higher. Verticale Lagrange (88-90-95-96-97-98-99-00-01-02-03-04-05) fvrier 2009 Farr's Christmas tasting.<br />Nice mature nose. As with all the 2001's, a little low key and retiring. Medium body, round and refreshing. Still some nice tannins on the finish. Good wine but no real excitement to induce one to part with the thick end of 30. Sal 91pts. This did not show as well as I hoped. Decanted for 2 hours. Ruby color. Lots of oak that overwhelm the fruit, but it is the drying tannins that are disconcerting. I have had a lot of good Lagranges and a lot of good 2001 St. Juliens, so I am willing to give it the benefit of a doubt that it is in an awkward stage. 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot, and 7% Petit Verdot. 13.0%. Medium to full-bodied. Floral and an opulent tobacco influenced sweet red possessing savoriness, finesse, good fruit quality, and a hint of cedar. Superb medium finish. Very well made and enjoyable now.

Smooth ready to drink now. This wine oozes class. Still dark colour with little or no bricking - nose is elegant with classic St Julien notes - there is a lot of purity on the nose. in the mouth this wine has quite a bit of stuffing to it and is much more full bodied than I imagined. great, dusty tannins and a lingering follow through. Nice acidity, very feminine and very very classy. This has years and years ahead of it. Outstanding. Will only get better Deep reddish-black in colour. Very closed at first - only really opened after an hour or so in the glass. Lovely nose of dark fruits, earth, herbs and graphite. Elegant palate with rich fruit and minerally flavours, fine tannins and a long finish. This is one of the most underestimated wines there existthis wine was very nice to drink from its youth andthis wine keeps improvingvery smooth with dark berries chocolat very feminin and silky finishthis chateau makes wine at a very high level year after year...one of the most reliable wines of the BDX area...www.everyoneweb.com/chateaujochen Initialy a good nose and a closed taste but then when the bottle was about a half hour open...It's open for business!!!The tipically taste from lagrange witch is just very hard to resist...very good QPR 20euro.Not a truly great wine because medium body but the fruit is there and the bottle was empty in a blink of an eye(so that's what everything is about) There's very few to say about Lagrange Another vastly underrated 2001. Full of ripe black cherry on the nose and palate at first, followed by a creamy second wave of redcurrant, then an attractive, moreish finish. I agree it won't hold for more than another decade, but in the meantime it will be interesting to compare this to the 00. Decanted 1 hr, cedar and smoke in the nose, concentrated palate, with dark plum, graphite, cedar and terroir. This bottle was quite youthful and could go another 5+ years. Chateau bottle, held two years, double decanted. Clean cork, no sediment. Opaque, red rim. Pretty aromas of red fruits, crushed stone, and a little green veggie action. Medium bodied, smooth, and compared to other Lagrange vintages a tad under-ripe, or perhaps a blend including a few more young vines than you will find in later vintages. Acidity is bright although not in balance completely. Smooth, long finish. It is tasty, but the most enjoyable aspect of this wine is on the nose -- at least at this point.<br /><br />This chateaux continues to improve over the past years as vines planted in the 80's and 90's contnue to mature, smaller tanks are used to vinify and develop each plot to its potential, and -- new for 2009 -- improved sorting will continue to improve selection. None of this investment is cheap -- it is an endorsement of Bruno Eynard that he receives continued backing from Suntori. <br /><br />I would love to see this 2001 harvest come through the Lagrange cellars in 2009 - I bet the resulting wine would be even better. Full bodied, smooth. This was a wonderful claret with loads of cassis and other dark fruit, vanilla, and spice box. nice rounded tannins and enough acid to provide a decent finished. A much better bottle than the Branaire I drank the next day. Dark cherries with some cabbage and a touch of cat's pee held up by some alc. Amateurish balance with detectable heat. There is enough fruit, enough acidity and just enough structure. However, this does not look like it will develop into anything interesting. Sweet seductive nose of ripe fruits and purple flowers. Monolithic inkish palate of sour berries and red dates. Not bad but not impressive enough. A big wine, masculine power behind it, cassis, graphite, pain du bread or however the french put it.<br /><br />Showing very well, and still has time to age even more. Another good showing from this wine. Smooth round and makes for nice easy drinking. At teh BA lounge and probably opened ( not decanted) for 30mins+ most likely. <br />Mild body and well rounded. Nice fruit and very typical bordeaux on the palate.Mild elegant nose. Drinks very well now. A very nice surprise. A little stiff with a weak mid-palate. Some sweetness inside. Broad but not focused. Young.<br />B/B+ I kept thinking silky, integrated tannins as I drank. Not a big wine but seamless from start to finish. Slightly acidic on the finish that complemented the moderate fruit. All in balance. I would drink this in the next couple of years...it is really good now. First time i had a Lagrange, and i would buy more... Drinking well now. However, not showing full potential yet. Wait until 2014 before trying again. Served with Grilled bone in New York Sirloin of beef with Bernaise, Chanterelle Mushroom risotto, grilled Asparagus. Very smooth and elegant. Has reached the perfect balance and smoothness - complex, quite full bodied and long finish - huge evolution since first tasting in 2005 where the wine was tannic and a difficult drink! Drink by 2012!! Ready to drink Very reasonable. Well balanced fruit, blackcurrant most notable. Soft tannins. Mid acidity.\"\n",

      "Centroid 12's Closest Sentence is \"Tasted whilst dining alone at Peppers Guest House in Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Australia. They drink their wines young in Australia  this 1998 Waverley was listed with an asterisk denoting that it was an aged wine and was one of only two 20th century wines listed on what was a fairly extensive wine list. <br />Decanted at my request, the Waverley was dulled crimson (not brown), and was initially herbaceous on the nose before giving way, on both nose and palate, to what I can best describe as berried dried earth; all the while light-bodied and quaffable. A glance at the bottle confirmed the reasons why. At a refreshingly modest 12.5% alcohol content, the Waverley was certainly drinkable (increasingly so, as it drew breath and reinvigorated). Moderately lengthy and with a mouth warming finish. A pleasant and unobtrusive companion to an excellent and attentively served meal of caramelised chicken livers on toasted brioche, followed by tenderloin of pork served with chorizo and green and red peppers. Bought from the cellar door, which specialises in selling aged wines. A refrshing change from the many too-young wines, or even young-drinking wines in the Hunter. What a good idea!<br /><br />Drank with the guys over a monthly dinner at Sage back in Singapore. Very nice, old Hunter Shiraz indeed. Classic meaty, leathery nose, with good dark fruit and a large dose of white pepper. Great, elegant structure, with fine tannins that have softened with time, and some freshness left. More Rhone (on a hot year) - try Cornas - than South Australlia in style. Went really well with our beef dishes. Hunter does not do many of these old-style Shirazes that takes time in the bottle anymore - what a pity that is too, as some of them really excel with age.\"\n",

Had with a chicken mushroom risotto. <br /><br />Nice deep plum colour. Deep sweet blackberry fruit with an interesting smokey overtone. On the palate it was ripe and sweet with well integrated tannins and good juicy acidity - I would not age this at all. Good easy drinking. Very similar in fact to the mid-range WA Syrah's. Losing its punch, little depth. Last of our stash. MLW - Smooth, balanced, subtle but very good - 88<br />MDB - Nice bouquet - 89 - 90 This wine and the next one were poured with our 4th course which was pan seared foie gras served with diced potatoes and porcini mushrooms in a veal reduction sauce. This was my 2nd favorite course. The Sommelier poured 2 wines with this course because he wanted our opinion on which was better with it. This Syrah is a better wine than my rating but it came off as very thin when paired with this very rich dish. Not a good match. 83-85 points Good dark core of ruby turning to light purple at the rim. A wonderful nose right out of the bottle of black cherry, vanillary oak, spices, and with air even some minerality. The oak is a larger component on the palate with toasty vanilla flavors somewhat masking the dark fruit. The oak seemed to lessen with air and overall this is a solid wine. Decanted  hr. Blueberry, meat, a little tar, white pepper and heavy oak spice framed by smooth but significant tannins that are a bit drying on the medium finish. An excellent Syrah for the price. Drink now and over the next few years. Spicy, full of fruit, well balanced finish. A very good syrah, exceptional for the price. A tasty chilean syrah with loads of black cherry fruit. It is very fruit forward and with little complexity. Ripe dark berries coat the palate. Medium to full body and with a nice aftertaste. Drink 2006-2009. Opened not decanted. Nice floral / berry nose. Tight out of the bottle, dry with a little heat and a trifle watery. I'm going to decant this and retry later.<br /><br />Decanted two hours Fairly fruit forward buy not as fruitful as some Paso Robles syrahs Wow. What a treat about $16. This wine captured what I used to like in California Syrahs 4-5 years ago. It was full-bodied with beautiful berry and cherry notes, and a touch of oak in a silky smooth package. Not bad but lacking some of the fruit of previous bottles and a little harsh. No notes. Consistant with last two bottles. Consistent with previous bottle. Consistant. Nice bottle of wine. This started off well, and opened up revealing some dark fruit, a well balanced vanilla oak, hints of coffee, and truffle. It was most enjoyable, especially given the reasonable price. Powerful, fleshy, and floral notes -- an odd combo. Luscious mid-palate and nice firm, but not overly done tannins. Great fruit on the nose; nice balance; not overly powerful with a firm and long finish. Delicious! Very disappointing. Rich wine with blackberry, loam, tar and minerals. The lush midpalate is brought into focus by the minerality and good acid and a little heat on the finish. Not necessarily elegant but the loam adds to the pleasure of this chunky wine. Took a minute or two to really open up. Once it did, huge nose of roasted meats, black plums and cracked black pepper. The palate wasn't as intense, but did consist of black fruits and nice gamey undertones. Full bodied, soft acidity and a medium-long finish made for a very nice Syrah. Excellent. Very smooth in the mouth with well integrated fruit flavors. Interesting finish - perhaps clove or cassis? Wonderful value as part of PA Chairman Select at $13. Drank right after a 2004 Two Hands Bad Impersonator at nearly twice the price and the Montes stood up well. Different style than the Two Hands, with more oak and tannins, and a more structured finish, although both finished very smoothly. The fruit was there as well, although not the wall of fruit that the Two Hands was. Drank with grilled pork tenderloin. Sorry I didn't by more of this at the time at $16, but will check out the 2004 vintage. Very Pleasant, not too sweet. some structure but not ...for the price a decently long finish. Nose is somewhat weak. Good weeknight wine. Consistent with the last bottle. Good weeknight wine - soft tannins, not too sweet, very smooth. Outstanding QPR. Was a tad bit harsh on immediate opening but after an hour showed wonderful dark cherry fruit flavors and a nice smooth finish. Excellant qpr. Very smooth with nicely balanced black fruit flavors. This bottle seemed a little off compared to previous ones .. didn't lose it's harshness but may have been me as I had been sick the last few days. Smooth and easy. Too astringent on the finish but it's all good to there. Earthy and minerally. Good color, not much of a nose, wine has some currant and cherry flavors, but it is a bit sour. Well integrated and the finish comes through nicely. Smooth tanins a tad heavy on the finish. Nice change of pace from Aussie Shiraz. Good wine. Oustanding Chilean syrah in the French style. Deep ruby in color. Powerful aromas of black pepper, currants, and a touch of fresh green bell pepper. Palate of black fruits, pepper, and roasted meats reminiscent of CdP. Peppery, spicy finish with a hint of clove. Lots of complexity for the price. Wish I had more. Will seek out the '04. Great wine. Some oaky vanilla on the front end, followed by some coffee, earth, and aggression on the finish. Really interesting and complex for a $17 wine. Big, fruity nose, followed up with a fruit-forward style that could stand a little more structure. Was expecting a little more complexity, but I didn't find much there to balance the acidity of fruit and pepper. Won't buy again. Juniper berry nose. Black berries well balanced with cinder, vanilla and smooth tannins in mouth. Finish mod to long with burnt brambles. Agree great QPR. 3, very nice, woody, vanilla, clean tasting. Very nice. Tasted at a \"bring your own\" blind \"competitive\" wine tasting of sub-$20 Southern hemisphere syrah/shiraz, and this wine was the top choice of 7 of 10 tasters, beating out a whole slew of nice Aussie shiraz. Very nice. Chocolaty, rich, earthy, silky, smooth, with nice subtle fruit and long finish. Nice solid simple little wine. Chocolate and dark cherries. Maybe starting to tire a bit. Just fabulous Chilean Syrah, optimally bottle aged and completely disagree with the drinking window, this still had plenty of life in it, probably another 5 years, wish I had more '03's - Dark, full bodied with a nose of intense plum, blackberry, cherry, spice, pepper, licorice and vanilla, very well structured, intense, yet balanced, velvety smooth on the palate with terrific length, awesome! (93 Points). this stuff is well made. nice floral nose, ripe fruit, tobacco, cloves. love the french oak, not overdone. tannins a bit on the grainy side but not overpowering the fruit. good concentration. kind of short finish but very tasty. hooray chile.<br />ps deep purple color, fruit-forwardstyle wine. Very strange, almost mediciny aftertaste. This baby really delivers for $18. Spicy nose layered over mounds of fruit. A treat on the palate all the way down, silky smooth tannins, nice finish. Not as over the top as some Aussie syrahs in this price range. Almost like a grenache and zin blend with some Rhone characteristics as well, very nice. A bit boozy upon opening. Given some time, dark red fruit and eucalyptus emerged on the nose. Palate displayed blackberries, pepper, earthiness and a bit of black olives towards the back of the mouth. This is an excellent bridge between an Aussie-style shiraz and Rhone syrah. Bery nose with tart berries up front on the palate. Soft velvet finish. Excellent Syrah. Wonderful with spicy food. Great QPR! This wine is rich, silky, and well integrated. Similar notes to previous users, however I noticed a slight herbal note on the finish. Sophisticated syrah that is polished and understated in fruit. Structured but smooth finish. Comes off blah compared to Austrailian shiraz in side by side comparison. Decanted 3 hours. Very enjoyable. Excellent -- smooth, fruity, nice finish -- very classy wine Excellent Syrah. Great fruit and enough complexity to make it interesting. Smooth finish. Has a great aroma with floral, tobacco and leathery notes. Strong and full bodied to the palate, with soft and mature tannins. A very long, elegant and satisfying after taste. Served with Grilled Steak A nice well-rounded, mellow syrah. Reminds me of a decent French syrah. Fruity, blueberries, on the nose. Another, distinctive wine from Chile. I really feel that the expression of terroir comes across in their wines. Lots of fruit, with earthy flavors in the background. Fairly short finish. Reminded me more of a rhone then a Domestic of Aussie Shiraz. Decanted, and this wine reall exploded. The fruit rushes forward, meeting the tannins, and finishing with dusty earth and some spice. Excellent wine. Nicely balanced Syrah with enough structure and complexity to balance the dark fruit. Didn't make notes during tasting, but look forward to trying this again in a few months. Very enjoyable and probably at its best right now. Nose shows dark sweet fruit (blackberry jam), balanced with leathery spice and some vanilla and floral notes. Flavors include plum and black cherry with brown spice that lingers into a nice finish. Shows good structure, but I'll drink up in 2007. Relatively harsh finish and strange flavor profile (tar, spice and wild grasses). However, this wine has a solid nose and is well extracted. Not as enamored with it as the first time . . . Very good, especially considering not my favorite varietal. Drank it a a cooler temperature than I normally would. Drinking second bottle for Turkey Day. Much better than the last bottle we drank, lots of dark fruit and cherries, more depth to this bottle, nice finish, tannins very subdued with a hint of oak, not bad at all. Decanted for an hour, on the nose lots of cherry fruit some spice. The mouth feel is medium, not silky but not harsh either. On the palate getting cherry and spice, not a lot going on here, fairly one dimensional, not a lot of complexity, the nose comes across a lot more interesting than the taste. Hour 2, flavor profile has picked up a bit, more fruit and spice onthe mid-palate, the finish is a bit tannic. I had a bottle of this vintage a year ago and recall it being much better. There's something very medicinal about the nose. Definitely some eucalyptus there, too. Flavors of chocolate and cherries. Some earthiness, as well. Firm tannins. The finish is a bit weak, though. I'm hoping this will improve with time in the glass. Salud! Decanted for 2 hrs. Wonderful nose fully of fruit. Medium body with a touch of pepper. Decanted for 3 hrs. Huge blueberries on the nose. Strong strawberries on the palate with a good long finish. Popped and poured. This followed a WL web-cast tasting of a Rioja and Arg. Malbec. This was WOTN by far. Loads of cherries and strawberries in a more fruit forward style. Tannins were well integrated. Popped and poured. Loads of red fruit, mostly cherry, on the nose and palate. Medium finish. COLOR - nice, dark red color. NOSE - nice nose, very S American, with a greeness apparent, and some pepper. TASTE - less flavor than I was hoping for, but a very good, straight-forward red wine. It tastes like it may not go for as many years as I hoped, or as many years as may be expected for a syrah, but it is quite good. RATING - 89. COLOR - a little thinner than I recall. NOSE - practically jumps out of the glass into your nostrils; outrageous. TASTE - thinner than I recall and wish for, but still present, ripe fruits that are red and black and still likely have some time to mature. This is a hotter weather Syrah than I like to drink, but this grape does well down south in the Chilean soil. And the individual hand-wrapping of the bottle in paper adds a point or two to the tasting... Verdict - hold a few and drink a few. RATING nice QPR! slightly muted nose...opened up a bit with some air. Great structure, with primarily pepper and spice on the palate. Nice finish with refined tannin. Deeep dark color. Dark rich nose, with hints of flowers and even a bit of dusty 'bazooka joe' bubblegum. There's also some chocolate milk, and a touch of late summer hay. This wine has one of the most intense aromas we've experienced. Cindy said of the nose, \"I just melted down to the tips of my toes.\" As the wine is sipped, it coats the inside of the mouth, and once again the aromas waft up into your nose. Lush fruit, very well integrated alcohol, not hot at all. We suspect this wine is at its prime, and that it won't keep for many more years -- just means we'll drink our other couple of bottles soon! A finish that doesn't even _start_ to fade for 60 seconds, and even at 2 minutes is still lingering.<br /> <br /> Delicious blend of spice and chocolate. Deep ruby colour. Spicy black fruit and olives on the nose. Round and layered structure with black fruit and blackpeppers. Good value. Nice wine, the extra time did not hurt this bottle. Deep flavor, good nose good 89 had with Shish kabob (beef) Popped and poured w/a glass airator, drank from Riedel Oregon pinot noir stems. Nose of dark fruits, earth and a very nice sweet oak/ smoke aroma. This is a medium bodied wine, and the six years of bottle age have added a nice softness and length (mellowing out the tannins from bottles tasted over the last couple of years). An elegant refined wine, that I enjoyed w/griilled salmon and an organic salad. I find the fruit is fading now a bit, and the alcohol is a little more pronounced than I can remember. Still very smooth and balanced. This bottle has plenty of life in it, very powerful, ripe and classy. Opened this after dinner. Full bodied, dark red throughout, this Chilean syrah showing a lush, ample nose of cedar, dusty red earth, ripe raspberry, tobacco, tar. Impressive aromatics. In the mouth showing a full, mature grained fruit profile featuring many of the same aromatic components. Nicely structured medium to full body with ample smooth finish. Day 2 under vac-u-vin showing some loss of the detailed aromatics, what's left has fleshed out - masses of toasty oak and black cherry. #62 wine of the top 100 wines for the year 2005 and I can see why, very solid. This is the \"middle\" wine in a 3 flight tasting of Shiraz, Syrah, and Cote de Rhone. Wood, cherry, oak, spice flavors and medium finish. Faint currant and blackberry with oak on the the nose. In the mouth, currant returns along with a pleasant, earthy minerality. We had the 2001 the night before. The '03 seems a little less rustic and more international in style. It's less distinctive but maybe a little better than the '01. Still a great value for daily drinking. On other occasions, the '03 has shown better than this one. When first poured showed a little bread yeast, but it blew off after an hour, leaving a nice syrah, with mainly currant fruit, licorice and pepper spice, with a little Chilean eucalyptus (which I like), and molasses from the oak. Bright nose as usual, the palate was a little underwhelming tonight. This wine isn't as outstanding as it seemed in fall '05. A very good value, nonetheless This wine has a pleasant nose. Its finish is long and smooth. Though this wine is considered to be past its prime I found it to be most enjoyable, fruity, and actually improved over the past year. At H Towers. Very pleased. No TN's, just dang good. With spicy chili, this is an excellent value. I'll re-up a few bottles of this. A score of less than 90 is undeserved and ill-thought. Rich and concentrated, nice peppery aftertase. very good fruit. Was afraid it may be past prime, but not so. Should hold a couple more years at least This was a fantastic wine when I sampled it in 2004, and is still wonderful. Dark cherry on the nose, and on the initial taste, morphing into warm ripe blackberries. Fairly soft and supple, with a little alcoholic heat. Nicely balanced and a long gradual finish. More recent vintages haven't been as rich.\"\n",

A bit of wax and breadth with time. Very pretty. Dark gold color. Nose is faint only getting citrus oil of some sort. Dry, but soft and round. An interesting wine with that lemon/citrus oil thing. It is a baby so I'll hang on the the rest for a while. drank in the cramped entrance to Tomasso's waiting for a table, it was cold and wet and made me less hungry. Did not really get to taste...Sarah and Sue liked it A great white, with floral, minerally, and honeyed notes. terrific. no contemporaneous tasting notes but i remember this as a wine of great delicacy and strength, light to medium bodied yet very tactile on the palate, with a classic honeyed/beeswax element and strong minerality. should develop into something really wonderful with a few more years in the bottle. 2d bottle. not as impressed as with first (consumed 18 months ago). lots of oomph and interest but whole package somehow lacks integration. was better on day 2, more reserved and in balance. i'm all out but i'd be curious to try this again in 2-3 years. Tasty, interesting white. Crisp, fresh, floral, medium body, great mouthfeel. Always instructive to drink old Chenin Blanc. This was mostly beeswax, honey comb, and apple peel in the aromas and palate and a distinctly golden color. Showing its age well, although I still prefer them younger and fresher. Sweet tones of honeyed apple slices on the finish that last a particularly long time. Quite singular in that finish. Definitely showing age. I don't have much experience with this varietal, but found it pleasant enough and enjoyed. golden. waxy, sweet chenin fruit coming across dull and lacking vibrancy on the palate. the finish was unremarkable. This is not a racy or high toned wine in any respect, but rather subdued and smooth like a cheap white burg. Paired very well with Indian food. Drinks dryer than demi-sec. Was too distracted to really pay attention but I liked it. Will wait a couple of years on the second bottle. Nose of grapefruit and white flowers. Paired well with plumpaste/wasabi oysters. Was a little better on it's own on the third day. f Attractive waxy chenin aromas with pome fruit and marmalade notes. Plump and ripe per the vintage, but tastes nearly dry. Generally a vintage I avoid but this is quite nice. Should continue to improve for another 3-5 years at least. Beautiful white wine. Enjoyed by the pool on Memorial Day. Nice fruit, very much like Chardonnay. Crisp, Clean. Thoroughly enjoyed! Still one of the best values around. Fresh, crisp, balanced. Long finish. Everything one would want in a Loire Valley wine. I find this wine rather dull, both in the nose and mouth. The nose is super-reserved, some elements of almond skin and honey, tangerine, but lacking excitement, very deaf-tone. The palate isn't struck much, either. The acid is far too in command currently, the fruit and freesia/linen quality restrained. I would say there is a fair chance of improvement, coupled with a corresponding chance of failure to mature.\"\n",

Raspberry what the best descriptor. Not raspberry in terms of hue in the color spectrum, but it looked like an actual raspberry minus the shape. The estate has bright, light, fresh fruit aromas upon opening, and the nose is pure burgundy. After 45 min in the decanter something interesting happened. The estate actually developed and unmistakable taste of earthy Oregon terroir. The amazing thing was that this oregonian presence didn't burst into spotlight, but rather stayed contentedly in the background for the remainder of the meal. This wine manages to imitate an old world pinot while still retaining a remnant of Oregon. If wine is supposed to be an expression of the wine maker as well as the terroir, then the estate is near perfect-it displays an elegance an balance that can only come from skilled winemaking/grape growing, yet it also captures the essence of Oregon without going overboard. The wine makers at Amalie Robert are so good at replicating old world winemaking that their wines can sometimes make the drinker forget that he/she is drinking a wine made in Oregon. If I had to travel abroad and bring a wine that represented excellent winemaking, and also the Terroir of my home soil, this is the wine I would bring with me.

A lot of the characteristics of the better half of this varietal. A must try. BF. Popped this last Friday night, ran through the vinturi. Not as refined or elegant as the last couple of bottles of this vintage. While much improved, from the case and a half I purchased years ago, this bottle was lagging behind the last few. Dark cherry aromas and flavors, w/some nutmeg, medium bodied and slightly unbalanced. Nice long finish, a couple bottles left...think these will continue to improve. This bottle was delicious, the way this wine has evolved the last couple of years is impressive. Deep rich aromas of cherry, rose petals and some spice. Rich matching flavors, a deep, & intense wine...that has come so far, from the early bottles of the case and a half purchased some time ago. My guess is this will continue to improve over the next couple of years. So much for the disappointment from earlier bottles, drinking beautifully now. Wonderful metamorphasis. Popped and vinturi'd, drinking from Woodward Canyon stems. Nose of cherry & alc along w/faint earth. A big Cali pn, biggest of the case or so I have in the cellar of this vintage. Too big, and too hot for many pinot drinkers. Some bottle inconsistency here, or this is evolving into a dark, brooding wine, in contrast to earlier bottles.<br />In drinking this last night, w/friends, one thought it was huge and bitter...another liked it...so to each his own...a decent effort, for most, but from Byron, always expect better than average. OK. Well kids, this is the best of the bunch, so far. Of the case + of this vintage, that I've got in the cellar, this seems to be evolving, and at least headed in the right direction. Aromas of rose petals and dark, deep cherry dominate on the nose. This is a pretty big wine, w/deep intense black cherry flavor, along w/some raspberry.<br />The alc is noticeable and the finish is hot, hoping these will improve over the next several months, because frankly, the previous bottles have been a disappointment.<br />86 is high, but I am a Byron homer, even though I reside in Oregon... Popped and poured Xmas Eve w/a spectacular Whole Foods King salmon filet, that our son masterfully smoked. Incredible meal, this wine was a tad tight and tannic upon initial pour, after sitting open in the bottle for an hour. Ripe cherry and vanilla aromas, w/a rich dark cherry/raspberry flavor, that does suck you in. Kind of a hybrid between a pinot/syrah, but very well done. Alc is high at 14.5%, but not noticeable here, for an Oregon pinotfile, I continue to enjoy the maturation process of this wine,which maybe blasphemy but, oh well. Drinking very well now, and will continue to improve over the next couple of years. I am impressed w/this wines progression, and am guessing this is why WE gave this a 92 score a couple of years ago. At that time, IMO this wine was nowhere near that. Looks like they knew something I, and other CT tasters did not Well worth your purchase, should you come across. Smell blueberries but a little acidic with short finish. Decent. Some tang of acid, some cherry. very clear, light red. i like the nose initially. little tart and bitter w/ slight mineral/alc finish. 2nd night For the last couple of years, Byron has produced some of the best values in domestic Pinot Noir, so I was really excited about the '07 bottling given that this was such an auspicious year for the Central Coast vineyards. Unfortunately, this wine fell short of my expectations, as it is overly acidic, with noticeable heat, and with none of that typically ripe Santa Barbara fruit; it almost seems like the winemaker kept all the better fruit for the more expensive bottlings, and only used underripe grapes, or grapes that were not destemmed. <br />A 1 hour decant improved the nose a bit by adding some barnyard notes, but it didn't cut out the heat enough to improve the palate. Another 30 minutes in the glass mellowed a tad some of the high acidity, but it also added bitterness on the palate. <br />Overall, this was very disappointing, but compared to everything else out there, it's still a good value California Pinot Noir if you can get it for under $20. Also, because of the very high acidity, it's a wine that's better with heavy/flavorful/spicy food, or with chocolate (better with milk than with dark chocolate), rather than by itself. This was a disappointing Pinot Noir. I was hoping for a more true to the grape Pinot Noir. Maybe I was overly excited since I have been having such good luck with this vintage. This was made in the style I call Pinot Syrah. <br />Overall the wine was good, for a lower end Syrah. For the price there are much better Pinot Noirs that look, smell and taste like Pinot Noir. I had one glass and threw the rest of the bottle out...it tasted candied or stewed, almost sickly sweet on the finish. I won't buy again. Elegant and supple tannins, nice fruit. Pop and pour. Strongly disagree with some of the low CT ratings here. Opened for ~1 hour before tasting. Over ripe raspberry nose, with some nameless spice and lots of heat. On the palate, berry fruit, some cola, and lots of alchohol. <br /><br />81 equates to the bottom of the \"good\" ratings. But, this is still a dissapointment. The '04 was a fabulous wine and brought tons of enjoyment from about a case worth of that vintage. This is nowhere near that. Not worth the ~$20USD I paid. Attractive aromas of ripe fruit, spice and flowers on the nose. This is very rich and full-bodied - almost syrupy - with lots of cherry and cola flavor followed by hints of pepper and mineral on the finish. Very good, but not quite outstanding. With a little more acidity to liven it up and a longer finish, I would have no problem rating this a 90+. My last bottle and a noticeable improvement over the prior one consumed about 9 months ago.<br />50+5+12+14+8=89 not exeptional, but a very nice somewhat simple Pinot that I would serve with any company.\"\n",

      "Centroid 21's Closest Sentence is \"Oh my, what a gorgeous wine. FE is never about depth and power, and this vintage shows the expected elegance and finesse, with great acidity and balance. Not so dry that it hammers you with minerality on the finish, more of an infusion of granite and limestone that runs through the wine from start to finish. Beautiful. Showing just a touch of color, cork was saturated fairly high, but no leakage at the top. Light petrol nose, this is a fairly fat FE, with some nice rich stone fruit quality up front, then transitioning to the expected intense, steely minerality, red apple skin, peach pit, decent though not blazing acidity. Very nice, in a good place, seems to be drinking a little earlier than 01 or 02 at this point in its life. Elegant and sophisticated. Refined, beeswax, a hint of petrol, subtle apple and lemon peel.

A good 5 years from peak, this should be really fine. (93+) Quite showy at the moment. Forward, a touch fusile with a bit of petrol showing, lots of rich fruit and some stoney notes. Should be quite nice in 10 years or so! - Yellow color and aromas of apple and apricot. It's in total harmony and has flavours of apple and apricot with a medium/full body. Juicy texture with a long finish - @ Michael's Genuine w Spring and Erica. Delicious Reisling w balancing acidity.

Petrol nose. Richer than the typical Trimbach CFE, but still nice acid balance against the soft apricot and floral flavors. Thoroughly enjoyable, if perhaps not typical. Drinks beautifully now but will hold for awhile. Excellent wine. Medium yellow, petrol nose. Good acidity balanced with a becoming roundness. Not as lean as some, but still has plenty of time ahead of it. Medium yellow. At this point in its life, just terrific interplay between ripe fruit, early petrol and tart green papaya acidity. Truly excellent. From my \"special\" batch that had been frozen in transit-cork extruded about 1/2 inch. Light yellow. Nectarine and citrus. This has an extra layer of flesh compared to the '05 tasted a few weeks ago that was really lean. Tart lemon/lime finish that was somewhat harsh to begin but then softened and added black tea. No secondary Riesling notes yet. Amazing that all of these damaged bottles have been entirely sound thus far, but this was not my favorite bottle of this wine as it never fully meshed. Limpid. Lime and green herb aromatics. Crystalline and lighter weight than usual. Beautiful development with a bit of petrol by the end. This bottle had the cork pushed out almost an inch and came from a shipped batch that I assumed must have been heat damaged along the way. Only problem-it wasn't. Light yellow color. Aromas of lime, tea, and faint dry peach. Fresh on the palate with mouthwatering acidity and rising minerality on the finish. Who the hell knows what happened to these bottles, but it was a completely unexpected pleasure to find this one in virtually perfect shape compared to my memory of it. Medium yellow. Completely dry, lime fruit, limestone and vibrant acidity. Not huge but very powerful. Bores right through the back of the mouth. bottle at the new Bliss in San Antonio. Golden color, thick petrolly aroma, full bodied Riesling on palate, good acidity, grapefruit , wonderful with food or alone. Nice wine, almost ****+. Nose honey lemony and citrus a bit of jasmine. Tea. Honey Citrus and a bit of lemon and a bit salty with a bit of flint. Quite elegant style. Old world. Tastes like a good German spatlese. Better than the Trimbach entry level wines by a mile - I thought this was really quite good. Very classily understated on the nose, this showed bits of rubber and petrol drops. some earthy mineral and nice white fruit. Very nice palate too. Nicely integrated fresh acid was wed to good concentration, with flavours of grapefruit and pears, some fresh figs on the midpalate and nice minerality. There was a silky elegance to this wine that I found pretty impressive. Finish was nice and long too, a little tight inititally, then opening up to show fruit, and then mineral, then spice, and finally emerging into fruit again - a nice unfolding across the back-palate. Very nice wine, but really deserves age and some good food to bring it truly alive. This came across as a very friendly, easy Riesling. I thought it may have been going through a rather awkward stage though. It was good, but nowhere near as impressive as the last bottle I had, nor indeed as impressive as most other Cuve Frdric Emiles from other vintages. It had a typically subtle nose of a young CFE, with little bits of petroleum drizzled over lemon and lime aromas, some slatey minerality and a little drift of white flowers. The palate pretty much carried on the same tones, with very citrussy lemons and limes at the attack bottomed out by some green pears on the midpalate. There was a good rich depth to the wine wed to a nice mellow freshness, with gently mouthwatering acidity weaving in and out fruit, giving the wine a nice, clean feel. It finished with just another bit of stony minerality and some spice. A very nice, friendly wine, but nothing really special. There was also just some alcohol at finish disturbed its overall poise. This was the group's overall #4 out of 6 Rieslings. It is still very young though, and should improve over the years. This has the bones to last a long time. Deep and concentrated, but quite young and primary - the nose reveals freshness, but also immaturity with tight notes of peach, grapefruit skin and white grape. Linear, dry and well focused on the palate with wonderful intensity. Still somewhat tight, though on the other hand this appears to be made in a restrained style with classy aromas of dried honey, mineral, dried citrus peel, and pink grapefruit. Rich and more expansive on the palate with brillant focus to the citrus, green apple and mineral flavors. Long finish. 91+ O - ljus gul m underbar lyster<br />D/S - aprikos, gummi, karl-johan svamp, undervegetation och med svartpeppar i avslutningen<br />Cuve p Osterberg o Geisberg.....klass!<br />8.5p Drank at Tom Aikens<br /><br />Slightly sweet with a rich selection of apple and citrus flavours.<br /><br />Little bit of acidity in good balance Medium lemon-green. Understated nose, yet complex. Very well delineated aromas, clarity. Minerals and honey. Still young. In the mouth it is round, has flavours of honey without being at all sweet. Acidity is high and the fruit is very concentrated and focused I think I've had more uninspiring wines than good from this producer. Admittedly the best I've had have been excellent but it's been a while. I felt this was trying to have a bit each way in that although it wasn't a sweet wine there was definitely some sugar there which didn't suit this at all. On the palate it was clumsy and lacking refinement making it pretty tough to sit back and enjoy. Herbal nose with some grape-fruit and minerality. Very distinctive. Light-mid bodied, very youthful but balanced. Long finish. A wine with great character that will be a masterpiece after several years in the bottle. Patience!<br />Tasted at the winery, Ribeauville, Alsace. fresh nose, with lots of limes and minerals; well-balanced and elegant substance. Compared with the Keller Kirchspiel 2005 we drunk before the Trimbach was (already) quite austere, with notes of ripeness and first signals of declining balance of the underlying acidity skeleton. Quite open nose with beginning petroleum, but also peach and honey. Wonderful balance. It is like a sweet winegum surrounded by lemon acidity. Very persistent and cuts through most dishes I can think of. Nose of perfectly ripe riesling, still young though. Left open for 3 days in the fridge, nothing has changed a bit since first opened (!) Medium body, sweet core surrounded by telltale Trimbach acidity. Deep yellow. Dried honey and yellow roses on the nose. Rich fruit, dry and high accidity. The wine handles the alcohol content (13 pct) without problems.<br /><br />PS! This wine won \"Gold Trophy\" in Decanter World Wine Awards 2010 (Regional Trophy). It's a good wine, by all means, but in \"Pereiks Wine Awards 2010\" it's not in for more than bronze. My note is also very different from the one given by Decanter. Outstanding Riesling. Slate and lime zest on the nose. Slight peat smoke. Flavors of dried apricot, candied orange peel, sea salt and star fruit. Well integrated and elegant with firm acidity. It's a very salinic riesling, but overall, nice. fresh nose of green apple, honey, lemon, petrol. round mouth, with long finale on acidity an then minerality. OK, but not good enough for the price. BUY 6. So, this is meant to be drunk from 2011 onwards and this seems about right. It is very pleasant about now, very good acidity and lemony and citrusy, but none of that secondary development (the diesel fumes nose) that is a great characteristic of Alsace Reisling. But, you can sense that it is on the way. Granted, one could argue that it is light, but many reislings are, early on; it is always amazing how an apparently light wine develops with age. I will chance a half-case and then drink it through the predicted period. In general, I am not a fan of Trimbach, I think many of their wines are insipid though the world seems to disagree with me. This is an exception, as is the Clos St Hune. Expressive spicy nose with flint and mosquito spray, some carambola and green chili.<br />Dry and medium bodied with carrying grainy acidity, moderate fruit and maybe some MLF -character Long finish showing almondy richness mixing in with the pronounced minerlity and the spiciness.<br />Very 2004 - which I totally dig. A powerful and slightly eccentric performance - not the most serious of vintages. But drinking somehow already. Should keep for 10-15 years pretty easily. Intensely flavored, a little smokiness, lots of minerality. Some petrol and rubber notes, but well-integrated and not unexpected for this wine. Excellent acidity - still has a long life ahead of it. Paired very well with food. A little pricy but definitely a fabulous wine. Young and tight, we decided to decant it to allow it to open up. After about 4 hours, it started to reveal citrus and stone fruit notes with a chalky and slightly smokey minerality and a slight touch of petrol. Great acidity and powerful concentration make quite an impact on the palate. Long finish. Shows great potential, but comes off as a little bit austere even after decanting, so this needs a long nap in the cellar. Moderate nose of stone fruit, honey and petrol. Medium body of pear, honey, spice and lemon curd. Medium finish. Not as clean and fresh as normal. Quite clumsy and with too much petroleum. Appearance WSET Systematic Approach - Group<br />Appearance Nose of lavendar and vanilla---lots of lemon and orange rhind, with a bit of tart cranberry---very smooth with a nice finish Alcohol Just becoming approachable. Lean and tensile, phenolic, nervy, with lemon/apricot/pith/black currant bud and mineral. Fully balanced\"\n",

The palate is creamy and shows fine tannins with tons of layered flavors, cherry, chocolate, tobacco, and more. Medium acidity balances out the wine well and I can say enough how this wine is a rich dense treat, with most likely a 5-10yr life ahead of it. 4/5 Incredible dark rich maroon with an unbelievable nose! Really intense and powerful like a getting hit in the face with a bouquet of raspberry, black licorice, thick molten chocolate, hawthorn and steak juice. Nice fine elegant tannins with great structure and medium acidity. But the PALATE! Fabulous creamy mouthfeel with ridiculously good flavors of strawberry, maraschino cherries and charcoal. Great wine. 4/5\"\n",

      "Centroid 28's Closest Sentence is \"The dark garnet color is rather pretty. I found more acid than others, maybe even a touch of VA. Bottle variation? Impressive grenache nose of beef blood and violets. Palate has black cherry, spice, licorice. Medium body. Juicy finish gives way to smooth tannins. I would give this a couple of years in hopes of a bit better integration. But a good food wine now. Similar report to previous bottle; I found it more rounded and with greater depth on day two, some softening of the edges and filling out. A good earthy, fruit-forward wine you can chew on. About a year ago I noted it was tightly wound; this is no longer the case. Sad to say I am now down to the last bottle, but it is now showing much more extrovertly than before. Splendid plummy aroma right out of the gate, plenty of ripe fruit, good grip and length. I foresee a few more years in this. The wine cellar can take a beating over Thanksgiving, both in the preparation of the food and with its serving. The last of our Rasteau I found half-consumed of a Saturday morning in the process of making a stock. That what remained was characteristic of this wine to date, ripe, plummy, grippy, earthy notes. Had some time to indulge second bottle on day 2 in a larger glass wherein the aroma had opportunity to fill the volume. While not particularly effusive, I detected some interesting notes of dried fruit and spices, almost like a Christmas pudding; this wine is more of the sun-baked than fresh fruit variety. This is further reflected in the darker, dried fruit and espresso on the palate. The aroma quite effusive and opulent upon opening, filling the glass with earthy, ripe fruit, a touch of smoke; quite full and lush in the mouth, chewy, spicy, baked fruits. Much to be savored if nothing to be lingered over. Dark purplish red in the glass, clear glint, plummy earthy aroma, quite voluptuous on the palate, dark cherry, spice, grip, some length, a lingering tart berry note, chewable. Perhaps you might not expect so much from a Villages designation, but this has much and more besides. Note that this is quite tightly wound on opening and needs time to open up. Even slightly tannic on the finish. May benefit from a bit more aging. Almost no decanter time, yet this was very drinkable and not overly tannic. It evolved so slowly that the wine left in our glasses tasted about the same on day two. Yet to find an '07 Rasteau I didn't like. Took a lot of air-time to come around, but it softened and opened nicely. Good texture, a little furry on the tongue. Hard to go too far wrong with an '07 Southern Rhone. We enjoyed this. I don't expect much evolution, but it is a well balanced drink today. Medium acidity. Integrated tannins. This black cherry red is drinking quite well now. Rich mushroom, black cherry and plum with a touch of firmness and tannins that are rounding into form nicely. I am not sure I would try to hold these more than another 5 years or so. Smooth black fruit, juicy, big, medium+ tannins and acid and body. Extracted. Not sure is this was the VV bottling. $27 From the very first sip, this was clearly a first-rate wine, with deep red fruit flavors, dark cherry,plums, notes of chocolate, very long finish. Decanted for a couple of hours and it gained a bit of complexity, but honestly it was excellent from the first. Another great 2007 from the Rhone... Nice dark garnet color, with some light passing through. Nice mouth coating Northern-Rhone style blend. Alot to taste here, but the Syrah berry and cherry notes stood out. Some spice and herbal notes, that actually play quite well with a variety of food, cheese,etc. Good mouthfeel, and the heat from the alcohol was well balanced against the fruit. Would not see this one lasting 10 years, but solid drink for the next 3-5 years. Drinking very well. Stood up nicely to a filet. Also added a nice kick to well-seasoned chicken. Bright fruit, with well integrated tannins. Fantastic for the money, upon opening, very smooth, decanted for 4 hours, the wine gained a tremendous amount of complexity, became much more rich and the finish was amazing. Opened first bottle of the case, ran thru filter and let sit for 30 min. Excellent aroma, young, tart, strawberry. Strong tannins and this is youthful, will want to wait a couple years for the next bottle. Lots of potential and the after taste lasts for ever. Looking forward to the next one. Poured through a Vinturi which brings out more fruit in both the nose and on the palate than previous bottles which were pop and pour. Still plenty of earth and a little bit of smoke. Very nice. I would consider giving it a full decant the next time. Pop and pour. Muted earth on the nose. Wine is very balanced and soooo smooth. I can't say anyone thing sticks out but a very nice wine especially at the price. Really nice CDR. Developed well over 3 hrs. in the decanter. Typical profile of dark fruit, earth, and medium weight. Well balanced acid and tannins. Great value. Elegant dusty nose with a deep garnet color. Flavors of earth, mushroom and dried red fruits. Not overly complex and really benefits from an hour of air. Enjoyable, tasty, a bit grapey, providing nice ripe dark berry fruit. Doesn't at all resemble any of the other tasting notes, so perhaps this bottle was flawed. Didn't change much with air or over the course of the evening. Would normally rate a wine like this 86-87. Deeply colored with powerful dark fruit on the nose - showing very young as would be expected at this age in such a warm year. Very fruit forward with nice structure. Great potential, so I would recommend waiting a few years to get a more balanced showing. PnP through Nuance Wine Finer. Cherries, earth, mushroom and some licorice on the nose. On the palate, wonderful balance between fruit and earthiness. Very enjoyable alone; imagine it would go great with food too. 91 points. Aloha! Out of the bottle, medium tannins, rich berry fruit and a dash of pepper (didn't see this in the other TNs); tannins quickly soften but don't fade; some CdR austerity on the fruit; nose also includes green garden; slightly low acidity / slight grip; at 14.5%, a little heat on the substantial finish that can't hide since fruit doesn't dominate (negative on palate score); brief decanting brought out darker, richer fruit with no fade on tannins and definite soft presence of pepper (positive); should age interestingly; dark purple ink; decent character on this. 50/5/13/16/8 Full and rich flavors. Well integrated. Interesting nose, unexpected fruit. Not that smooth but nice complexity. Very drinkable. Not sure if 90+\"\n",

The sign of a GREAT Madeira is when endless descriptors can be applied, and this wine was a thesaurus exploding in the glass. Elegant and light on the palate, almost weightless.

      "No one knew for sure exactly what this was...the label long gone, no branding on the cork, etc. It arrived with a consignment mixed case of 1870 Madeiras from Vinhos Da Madeira Ltda. containing both Verdelho and Malsey bottles. Whichever it was, it was nice. Brownish gold color with nutty caramel tones. Rich nutty flavors coat the palate and hold through a long finish.\n",

      "This is a replica both in appearance and taste of the 1874 Macallan. The 1870's was considered the golden age of whisky-making. There is a \"zest of orange with a hint of lemon and an undertone of new sapwood\". Something which comes from ageing in fino sherry casks - a necessary but however insufficient condition for this quality to manifest.\n",

      "This wine was purchased by Barbeito from the Alfonso family and comes from the Cama dos Lobos vineyards. Butterscotch, molasses and honey. Hints of vanilla. Higher in acids than the 1895 D'Oliveira Malvazia (which makes it better, in my opinion). This wine is interestingly both contemplative and hedonistic. I could easily drink this all night without tiring. Lean (for Malvazia) and mean and long in the finish. OUTSTANDING. (Lockkeeper's, Cleveland, OH) Yum. Startling dry with intense caramel and lime notes and and a seaspray background. Different than expected, but intricate balanced and delicious. Didn't linger on the palate was the only downside. Can't say that I have ever tried something like this before. Totally amber in color, a nose that would cut through a dense cool winter fog with a big whip of an alcohol sword with caramel dripping from it. 19th century. Really appreciate Frank sharing this with us.\n",

Keeping things in the proper perspective, that was the year Lizze Borden chopped up her family with an ax, Thomas Edison began making silent movies, Grover Cleveland was president and Hawaii still had a queen! Im tasting bottled history with this wine as its almost 120 years old! Its an honor and privilege to hold the bottle, swirl and sip a wine that was made two centuries ago.

This wine would have been very expensive on release, much more than the first growths.<br />A mid amber, surprisingly light and clear, initially a slightly musty nose, with some burnt citrus and fat dried fruit. Almost fully dry on the palate, with a slightly bitter element, that developed and ruled the finish, quite concentrated and creamy, still a hint of acidity. Facinating of not great.\n",

We had its brother an 1899 Clos Vougeot from the same producer several years ago and it was also an amazing wine.<br />The 1893 was light in color but it more than made up for its look with a sweet cherry almost like a cherry carmel chocolate infused with orange and floral notes. The wine seemed to get richer on the palate as it sat in the glass, we all could not get over the fruit and structure this wine pocessed. My friend Steve declared this Burgundy the greatest wine that he has ever drank only surpassing the 1893 that I shared with him previously.

      "Ordered off the restaurant wine list after scaling mount Nebbiolo. An interesting wine that brought us back to where we started -- the madeirized 47 Monfortino. I recall enjoying this, but my palate was completely shot at this point in the evening. Ordered off the list. Bottled in 2000. Interesting caramel nose, but the palate turned hot, astringent, and acidic. Not a fan. This wine ushered in a huge jump in impact and intensity. The nose exhibited an extremely extroverted mixture of butterscotch, molasses and orange skin  a wine that could satisfy me by smell alone. Lovely dried fruits and spicecake flavors swirled on the palate; laser-like acidity remained in perfect balance with the sweetness. Clearly the wine of the flight for me. From what I understand, this was the wine served at the wedding of Ricardo deFreitas mother (Ricardo is the managing director at Barbeito and the grandson of the founder). OUTSTANDING.\n",

I beautiful bronze colour gave way to a heavily orange bouquet which was a cause for concern. When I tasted this, I wouldn't say that the bottle was flawed but something was definitely off with this. Overly orangy and severely tangy. I realize that over the years I've been very fortunate to try a number of very old Yquems and greatly appreciate anytime I can try an aged one, but tonight this bottle fell very short of my hopes.

Full-bodied on the palate, with medium acidity and apricots on the palate. It was a treat to taste this old Leoville, a vintage harvested seven years before the birth of my father!

The wine ceased to exist beween 1983 and 1986. The vines were purchased by Chateau d'Yquem. For people interested in how this wine tasted, imagine sour, lemon juice in desperate need of sugar.\n",

Cappellano is now brought in locally by Louis/Dressner and Joe Dressner has this interesting tidbit about the wine on his very entertaining blog. Its the color and texture of peach Snapple iced tea, but boy, what an intriguing and weirdly delightful nose. Maple syrup candy with eucalyptus and a touch of mint. Sweet and complex on the palate. There is an herbal-tea like quality to it, with maple syrup, pine needles, herbs and old, worn wood. The description may sound bizarre, but we were all loving it. Huge amount of sediment on the bottom. In fact it looked like a toad hopped into my glass when a chunk fell out. However, its extremely soft and not a problem to drink/eat, unlike the gritty texture most sediment shows. A rarity and a perfect jaded geek wine. A.\n",

      "Doesn't actually say moelleux or demi-sec or anything else on the label, just straight-up Le Haut-Lieu, but demi-sec is how it tastes, at least now. The color of this wine alone bespeaks something special -- dark Cherokee-red and Cognac color with a refraction of deep green around the edges that almost seems to cast a radioactive glow. The fruit profile is more red than white, packing in raspberries and cerise that still come across plump and fresh-picked. Remarkably dark amber colour that had me worried initially, along with a musty funk that dominated the aromatics. With time the aromatics clear up and reveal a combination of fresh and baked peaches, quince and apple fruit layered with developed smoky, creamy and gentle honeyed flavours. There's a sense of lightness and understatedness to this, presence and power with barely any sense of weight, and tremendous persistence. Wow.\n",

On first whiff, you could swear you were sticking your nose in a Pedro Ximenez sherry, but when you taste this, there is remarkably little oxidation and an incredible array of aromas and flavors-nuts, toffee, citrus, cherry, apricot. Great acidity including some VA. Not nearly as unctuous or weighty as say a Sauternes of this age might be. Endless finish, great staying power and even improvement as it breathed. Pretty amazing and easily the wine of the night.\n",

A mix of gold and amber in color, this classic wine was filled with beeswax and was honied, all of what you would want from an older Demi-Sec. Round, but not sweet, and with a great richness on the palate. A deep complexity that one has to experience rather than put into words. Bob felt that the wine was \"made for Mortadella\" and we were able to test this theory with the wonderful antipasto plate we paired this with. An ageless classic. Nearly 60 year old Demi-Sec drinking beautifully. Hats off to the Huet family for their mastery of the Vouvray terroirs they farm. 50+14+13+9+9 = 95\n",

Extremely lively acidity with a zesty lemon/lime bite. The vise-like grip was long and forceful; continues to linger long after it was spit out.

In the mouth, this fruitless, hard, charmless and overly acidic, tart wine sucked the juice out of my mouth like a sponge in surgery. With all the Gilman scoring controversy, please allow me to explain how this lifeless wine managed any points. A wine scores 50 for being wet and produced from grapes.

But a musty aroma blew off quickly leaving behind rose petals and kerosene from this thick, oily wine. The color was a beautiful gold approaching amber. No cloudiness was evident. This wine was smooth, complex and honey-flavored, but not overbearingly sweet like honey, with lemon zest, apricots, and a hint of smokey cedar.

The bottle and label were clean, the spirit level came up into the neck. and the cork was easy to extract. The color was a light golden brown. When opened it had a very attractive floral aroma. The flavor was subdued. The sharp alcohol searing sensation common in younger Cognacs and Armagnacs was gone. There were hints of aprocot and vanilla. My favorate Armagnac was a 1955 Semple, which unfortunately I can no longer get -- that bottling was full of fruit and vanilla. This Armagnac does not reach that level but it has a much broader flavor profile than many of the other Armagnacs I have tried including a 1960 Sempe.

It's surprisingly muted on the nose, but on the palate it's a razor wire bullwhip that thrashes the insides of your mouth with acidic fury. Yeah, there's some typical quince, bergamot, shoe polish and mineral to add a little pleasure, but this is about as much into S & M as I want to go. Please pass the sugar. B-.\n",

      "Honey & nougat nose, overlaid with a nutty maderization. Wood spice & cinnamon notes. Palate follows the nose to a degree, weighty, with almost an amontillado aspect to it. The aging has bequeathed some pungent notes and the wood-like flavours, all of which is interesting; but the single biggest effect of the oxidative effects has been to truncate the finish somewhat, which is a pity.

There was also more than a touch of 'farmyard' about it (which I find enjoyable at this sort of level).

The only thing more mysterious than how this wine managed to hold up so well for so long is why anyone who owned such a beauty would choose to sell it... their loss, my gain. You almost expect this to be frail because the color is an utterly translucent rusty orange. But take a whiff and it drips with sweet tar, exactly what old nebbiolo should be.

A bit more acidity would merit a higher score, but this wine was in essence perfect. Not terribly complex, but a stunning example of a vintage being left to history. No decay, could last another decade.\n",
      "Wine Variant: S&#233;millon-Sauvignon Blanc Blend\n",
      "Half bottle. Bad level but still a healthy colour; not maderised but very evolved, starts out like a fino sherry, then there is caramel and Turkish delight; medium-dry, certainly more than just interesting.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Ullage 7cm. Sherried but still lively, well-constructed and balanced, minerals, pleasant. Impressive. Fullish yellow, golden sheen; aromatic, grapy and spicy, delicately sweet, hint of matchstick; holding up well, only the merest hint of oxidation, nice chalky acidity; excellent length, delictely fleshy. Very old Chablis can develop into something that closely resembles Barsac (or in some cases even Sherry) and this is a wonderful example.\n",

      "230 Oechsle, 14 gr TA. Beautifully matured nose, lemon- and orange peel, faboulous fruit; perfectly fresh on the palate. The most perfect TBA.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "From memory. Very light colour (hardly any botrytis); slightly lactic nose, Linden's citrus blanc mangé actually a very apt description, incredibly light and fresh. You would never guess this was half a century old. Seems to defy time.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "(*, open label) Just a minimal hint of petrol on the nose which also showed dried apricots, pistache, honey, hay, wax, smoke and sugar-pecans. On palate this kaleidoscope of nuances continued... cumin, shrimps, incence, Turkish delight and a whiff of nutty Oloroso. Full bodied wine which size increases during aeration (!). The endless dry and clean aftertaste has brisk acidity which is so enduring, it's difficult to grasp. 19/20 (*, open label) Second time in a year I had the opportunity to expericence this heavenly stuff. Ochre/yellow/gold. This wine is so unbelievably soft, fresh and good that it blows my mind. It's even more glorious and vivid than the example from earlier this year. Gorgeous weighty structure. Delicate sweetness goes hand in hand with brisk and mouthwatering acidity. Endless finish. Especially the almost indifferent, nonchalant manner this wine was presenting and unfolding itself after sitting in the bottle for more than 50 years, left me speechless... 19,5/20 and probably this score is too stingy.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "(Reconditioned). Good color, a pretty floral nose, secondary. Light and sweet on the palate but with a hint of dryness on the finish. One very experienced taster in the group pointed out that the dryness may be a result of the original wine and the younger wine used to recondition may not be fully integrated. A fun and delicious wine for a village.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "Tasted with Dirk van der Niepoort at their restaurant Degusto in Oporto - What a nose! What every tawny port wishes it became. Obviously this is quite old. Wonderful full bodied palate. Endless finish. Not cloying at all. Extremely impressive! 96 points.\n",

      "Respectable pop when pulling the pristine cork. Little mousse to speak of unless poured aggressively, and then the bubbles were large. Pale copper color. Bottomless but subtle tropical fruit, racy acidity, and a nutty finish on the palate. Served with shrimp bisque, shrimp and sweet potato tempura, and crepes stuffed with spinach, onion, proscuitto, then covered with nutmeg-spiced bechamel and parmigiano reggiano. A numerical rating seems trite, otherworldly plus.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Nice amber/amontillado color. Resinous nose of quince paste, orange peel, maple syrup and dusty soil. Obviously a late-harvest, sweet wine at inception, this is now off-dry, richly-textured and just lovely. The Fass 65 Kabinett has the steely tension of a great Saar riesling, but the warmth and resonance of the Rheingau. Perhaps a tad past its prime, the wine still offers plenty of pleasure.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Very impressive nose for an old wine, had complex hazelnut, berry and floral perfume aromas back up by hints of light oak. The color was of fading brick with only slight brown on the edges but pretty dense in the middle. The body was just as impressive with a myraid of berry, nut and minerial flavors. The finish was the only evidence this wine was showing age, it was thin, flat and abrupt compared to the richness of the nose and body. Overll, a fun and interesting wine to drink.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "On the nose light and neutral but not hollow, discreet but no false notes, hint of overripeness; remarkably lively, light but flavoury, good acidity keeping it all together; decent length. May have withered a bit but is clearly still very much alive.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "Fabulous. Nutty and sweet nose. First notes are of walnuts and dried apricots. Next candied fruits, chocolate, peach and a hint of caramel.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Cabernet Sauvignon\n",
      "This was the surprise of the night, as I was not expecting much, but this was truly a testament to the age-ability of Nebbiolo. Purchased though an online auction for $1, but then $65 dollars was added in shipping fees from Italy to the US. The bottle was in superb condition, with the fill level just into the neck. The cork seemed reasonably old, breaking in half upon extraction. Light garnet in color. This was light and lean yet crisp and refreshing. A lot of fruit has dropped, but lovely secondary notes (mostly dried flowers and forest floor) entice the senses. Lively on the palate. Surprisingly, this improved with air, opening up more and providing a more generous palate. Fabulous showing.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Nebbiolo\n",
      "Another oddball from a friend's stash. Like the '59, the color was amazingly light, even more so. A true sec, this had beautifully crisp quince fruit and brisk acidity with a cleaner, more pleasing finish than the older wine. All it lacked to make it great was some concentration, but this was still quite a treat at this age.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chenin Blanc\n",
      "This Sauternes had taken on quite a brown colour but was indeed a very tasty drink. Liquorous and nutty with some honey and cinnamon notes. Quite round and gentle in the mouth with sneaky persistence.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "The ullage was towards to the middle of the neck. The color was a tawny shade of brown with a slight core of amber/crimson in the middle. On the nose I got some faint fruit but mostly aromas of almonds, cream and a slight mintiness. The palate was suprisingly sweet. The wine fell apart fast but was a really interesting drink.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "This was by far the lightest colored wine of the night - almost clear pink. The wine had a fine nose of tea and roses. There was no tannin to be found on the palate. The wine had light acid as well. An ethereal and almost weightless wine. Sweet strawberries comingled with the sweetness of decay. This wine is like a fine old lady now. Ray commented that this wine shows similarly to some 1940s Burgundy he has had. An interesting, enjoyable and rare wine experience.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Nebbiolo\n",
      "The labels did not specify whether this was sec, demi-sec, moelleux etc. Top 5mm of cork blackened and fraying, rest of cork excellent. Splendid, lively orangey gold colour. Subtle nose of white flowers and celery with a hint of what could be oxidation. This has the very slightly thicker texture of a sweet Vouvray but is not gloopy. Covers the palate with a sensation of liquid marmalade with a little sweetness but more Seville orange bitterness. A great pleasure, perhaps more intellectual than sensory because of the bitterness.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chenin Blanc\n",
      "This bottle looked pristine. New label and capsule. When opened, it also had a new cork. Counterfeit? Not likely, as this was purchased through the Rare Wine Company, which is the official importer for Huet. This must have been reconditioned at Huet. A lovely, bright, dark yellowish/gold color; practically no sediment. Heavenly on the palate, with honey, marmalade, marzipan, honeysuckle and brown spices. Fabulous acidity. With air, a more pronounced mineral note emerges. Super vibrant, alive and unbelievably youthful. Wow! A perfect match with butter poached lobster tail and risotto.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chenin Blanc\n",
      "Lanolin, mandarin, wax, resin and some funky earthy characters on the nose. Superbly balanced palate, I expected it to be sweeter but it had quite good richness instead. Still youthful thanks to the acid and structure of the palate. Very good. Without a doubt, these wines can last ! Deep golden color, fantastic aromas of beeswax, wildflower honey and walnuts. The palate is fresh, mineral and feels almost semi-dry with deeper and more complex aromas of honey and nuts. The body displays a wonderful balance and the finish is short- to medium-length. Enticing mature chenin nose, matched the chateauneufs in being smooth and creamy on the palate, but lacking a bit of bite De belle densité et à l'acidité qui a vaincu du sucre, c'est un vin complexe et plaisant, sans toutefois être grand. La couleur fauve-doré trahie l'âge vénérable de ce vin. La palette aromatique est complexe avec une bonne pointe d'oxydation agrébale, avec une touche de noix et cari, mélangeant les fleurs blanches séchées au miel et à la cire d'abeille. En bouche le vin est demi-sec, avec une acidité vive qui rajeunit le vin. La bouche est ample et complexe et ramène les noix en arrière-plan. Plutôt court, mais un vin de méditation et de plénitude.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chenin Blanc\n",
      "Color somewhat darker gold than the first wine, acidity is getting older and more iron-like, but this wine has enough concentration and complexity enough to compensate for that. Impressive definition of dried fruit (apricot, peach, plum, orange-oil). This one was older and dryer than the first wine (Christoffel-Prüm's Würzgarten Feinste Auslese 1971) and therefore was a perfect prelude to the next one (Nicolay Goldwingert Auslese 1949). 18/20<br />NB.\n",

      "Sharon brought this along thinking this was Doughertys birth year. I guess Joe looks young for his age as hes a couple of years older. Golden colored. Ben, being a Chenin newbie, thinks the wine is corked. Hes quickly schooled on the lanolin/wooliness character aged Chenins often exhibit. Rich, with honey, apricot, bergamot and mineral flavors. It lacks the mid-palate excitement and depth of an old late harvest Vouvray, but is holding up well and drinking nicely. B+.\n",

Everything about it, including the acidity and residual sugar, is soft and gentle, but the finish is short. An enjoyable and interesting aged riesling. g Very kindly brought by Linden to sunday lunch tasting at my house. An incredible showing for such a reputedly poor vintage.

      "Tasted at Acker auction at Revel courtesy of Ray - The nose was all chocolate and peanut butter, or as RJ would say truffles and grains. More PB on the palate with some minerals and still great acidity. Really nice. Bested my bottle of '71 Dom. Brought into the office by a colleague who thought, because of the ullage, that it was beginning to deteriorate. In some ways he was right; the nose was seriously maderised, however, not that it affected the natural meaty Krug character which was still apparent and very prominent. There were still a few bubbles on the side of the glass when it was poured and there was a noticeable petillance on the palate. The colour had a greenish hue that one would associate more with old white Burgundy than with Champagne, and equally on the nose, the toasted brioche characters were interwoven with a honeyed intensity that made this such a pleasure. The palate was a dumb in comparison, yet the richness and viscosity was undeniable. If stored properly, I could see this wine lasting another decade at the very least! ****\n",

      "Before the modern system there were Auslese, feine Auslese, feinste Auslese and hochfeinste Auslese. These have now become Auslese, GK, Lange GK Auslese and stars. So this is what would now be GK Auslese. Orange colour. A lovely aroma of copper kettles and bruised apple - though obviously oxidative, this is incredibly lively and doesn't seem tired at all. It seems dry and racy on the palate, the sugar has vanished, it is steely and racy and there is nothing soft about it. Lovely.\n",

      "Comes across a lot more youthful than the '63, showing a lot more density and power with the honeyed flavours much more prominent and rich orange peel, cooked pear and citrus flavours underneath. With some air some more earthy, smoky and faintly spicy elements emerge, though this didn't show the same complexity or elegance as the '63, feeling a bit fatter and rounder. Still very tasty and a great experience. Thanks Stephen!\n",

Not even sure one can call it a wine!<br />The nose hit us with white truffle oil/essence. Each of the eight of us at the table asked the generous provider whether he or the sommerlier had added this to the wine before serving. It was a knock-out punch that knocked you back.

Poured through screen into a decanter and allowed to breathe 30 minutes before tasting. Clear light golden-amber, lighter than expected for this age. Wonderful notes of apricot, butterscotch, and allspice. Similar on the palate, with enough acidity to balance the sweetness. Unctuous body.

Beautiful floral bouquets of melons, honey, rose, banana, pine nuts and raisins. Buttery, sweet silky sticking to the palate, integrated layers of fruits revealing itself slowly, with acid holding it's delicate structure. Sweet long raisins finish w/hints of truffles aftertaste.

The capsule was intact if a bit dirty, but the cork, when revealed, was fairly clean, if depressed a few millimeters.<br /><br />The cork crumbled.

Upon watering (just the smallest splash), floral notes bloom, silky and now less honeyed; dark toasted walnut nuttiness emerge, along with antiseptic.

Medium gold in color, this unique opportunity provided a wine full of spice, particularly cloves, and a very long and complex finish.

      "Honey, white flower. Very yellowish in color looking very aged. Palate is quite light lacks structure seemly lacks acid. But second pour seems more lively prob as wine warms. Still able to provide some interest. However, if this wine was not quite dead yet, it was certainly standing at death's door. Nose showed a strange melange of toffee and caramel along with earthy mushroom scents, curry leaves, salmon oil, dried oysters, chicken essence and umami. Almost Chicken Chickadees like, for thos who have had that MSG laden snack before. Palate was all but hollowed out, with vestiges of round acidity and ripe limes, along with caramel, spice and dried figs dominating. Finish drops rather alarmingly, with a final show of preserved fruits (limes and figs), some nuts and dried wood. This might have been rather some 15-20 years of more ago - it certainly begun its downhill track a long while before we got to it. This is a totally different bottle from the previous bottling we had. It lays claim to the theory that with whites, bottle variation becomes more pronounced with age. This bottle is much more palatable. Minty menthol euclyptus, aparagus and barley beans.Very vegetal. Also tastes sligtly menthol with character. Touch of wet moss. I kinda like this bottle with its seemingly awkward trot . Does beautifully with mushroom soup. Very caramelised and oxidised honeysuckle and lots of soy mixed in. Essence of chicken and satly. Dead but archaelogically educational. Unscorable .\n",

      "Gorgeous shade of bronze with a singing nose of apricots, apple, almonds and boytris. Palate is sweet but light bodied with low viscosity. Impecably balanced with lively acidity. Everyone guessed aged Mosel - what a shocker! no note. this was interesting and surprisingly decent.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Brought by Josh K. Cloudy. Nose of sharp old citrus, tar, burnt rubber and meat. Very bitter on the palate. Dried out with dried meat and burnt rubber again. Nose - 3/6, Palate - 3/6, Finish - 2/6, Je Ne Sais Quoi - 0/2 = 15.5/20.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Red Blend\n",
      "Light carmine. Expressive and special bouquet with spices i.e. pepper, oak and fresh mown grass. Hardly any tannin left. Light bodied. Fresh and friendly with a little butter in the finish. A wine that makes you feel happy. Not a wine to write a book about, but so friendly and pleasant.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Red Bordeaux Blend\n",
      "Not stored well--received as a gift. Dark amber. Nose of almonds and honeysuckle. Quince, almonds, tropical fruit, and apricot. Quite primary.\n",

      "Drank the wine on 4 occasions the last year with consistent notes; very light bodied, acidic and at the end of its life. This is the last bottle. There is some class noticeable. However, the wine is too acidic and light bodied. Needs to be drunk now.\n",

      "Wouldnt dress a salad with it. Medium brick in color, browning at the edges, aromas of wheat and baking (in a pleasant way), what little fruit remained was all dry cranberries. An enjoyable first nose, which dissipated quickly, leaving a dried out and clumsy wine. I havent spent much time with this vintage, although I did have this one once before, several years ago, and dont remember it being as over the hill then. So its possible that this bottle was off. Any comments on this or any of the other wines tasted are more than welcome.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Sangiovese Blend, Sangiovese\n",
      "Light orange hue. Smelled like tobacco and shitake mushrooms with some earthiness. Sour fruit and soy sauce on the palate. Very interesting. I thought this might be pretty old as I guessed mid 70s due to color and smell. Very cool to try but best days probably gone!\n",
      "Wine Variant: Barbera\n",
      "Very fresh, darkest of the flight, licorice, strawberry thubarb tart, caramel, cinnamon, mushroom and earth. Excellent concentration but the fruit expression is straightforward. Impressive wine nevertheless.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Nebbiolo\n",
      "(AP 27 76) Deep golden colour, even a hint of dreaded brown. Aromas of creme brulee & caramel. Even the acid has faded away quite substantially. The burnt caramel flavours do grow on the palate, and although I would say this wine too is past its peak its still quite drinkable, unlike the Durtheimer. The extra degree of sweetness gives it a gently decayed quality, a kind of mellowness which co-incides nicely with a cheese plate!\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Totally dominated by brett. Didn't seem to blow off. Tasting it it was just rather over the hill than anything. light, pale, a touch astringent in the finish. Not much going on really.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Sangiovese\n",
      "Capsule had partially corroded onto the cork so took some time getting off. Gorgeous, deep gold colour on pouring with plenty of bubbles left. Utterly pristine showing. Amazingly vibrant wine with deep notes of honey, orange peel and a bit of walnut. Incredible.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Red Bordeaux Blend\n",
      "Deep gold hue with scents of apricots, nectarines, caramel, peaches and vanilla. Better on the nose than the palate where it lacked ample sweetness and depth. The wine finished with caramel, light oranges and apricot, but was clearly starting to dry out.\n",

      "High fill. Cork shrunken and loose; removed intact. Not decanted. Slightly hazy, medium amber. Wonderful, complex notes of apricot, apple cider, butterscotch, mulling spices, and, thankfully, no petrol. Fresh and crisp, left me wanting more. Superb with wiener schnitzel.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "I rarely rebuy anything when I go to Bern's Steakhouse, but this Nahe riesling I have had twice. This Kabinett has really held up. Beautiful golden color a nose that screams aged German riesling. Slightly on the sweeter side, but a lovely experience.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Deep golden. Surprise of the night. Petrol with some botrytis initially, that seemed to lessen with swirling. Nice mouthfeel but lacks acidity. On it's decline with some oxidation, however, drinkable and a favorite by several in the group.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "This had a lovely peachy nose, and a very honeyed sweetness, but some acidity too. The age only really showed in the slightly attenuated finish. A rather lovely wine.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Pale, almost Sherry-like, watery amber colour. The nose had hints of dates, caramel and some citrus. The taste was deep, satisfying and very classic tawny in it's character. Oxidized smooth raisins coupled with fruitiness and hazelnuts. Thoroughly enjoyable, even though it might have been kept in barrels a tad too long.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Port Blend\n",

      "Original 1975 1.5L sourced 20 years ago in London and brought over for this dinner. The freshness was simply amazing and while it was a very good Krug, it didn't reach the heights of greatness. Lip smacking acidity, crisp tart apples and pears. Long on the senses. Tons of bubbles..\n",
      "Wine Variant: Champagne Blend\n",
      "The bouquet is oxidized and stinky. On the palate also tertiary and nutty flavors. Bone dry and some bitterness and caramel in the finish. Many years past its prime, but the surprise was that it is still drinkable. No score.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Sauvignon Blanc\n",
      "Rusty nose. Palate is all acid.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Weissburgunder, Pinot Blanc\n",
      "At first the nose came across as musty which blew off a bit to reveal licorice, mushroom and beef broth. On the palate, I found sour blackberry, which was at first enjoyable but marred by a highly acidic finish that I can only describe as similar to sucking on a lemon.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Charbono\n",
      "Fresh chives and caramel nose with a lemon sherbert palate that evolves to lemon curd. Then turns in to liquid biscuits (Petit Lu). Small concentrated bubbles. Still fresh after 36 years.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Champagne Blend\n",
      "A super-intense copper aroma; dry but sweet paradox on the palate, grippy; lovely. Incredible amber brown color. On the nose, there's a fresh and earthy smell of pine pitch. On the palate, this is straight up grilled pineapple and peaches. Not much more life ahead of it.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Forgotten, filigree vintage. Lighter yellow-green. Lifted, floral, citrus blossom, freshness. Graceful, &#1080;&#1079;&#1103;&#1097;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081;, mangos, exotic fruit, grapefruit and orange zest. Mineral. Lovely. Very grapefruity. Feminine. To drink now. E. Tasted at the Prinz von Hessen treasury tasting in Schlosshotel Kronberg.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Bizarrely, my 2nd 1975 Ockfener of the year. This was noticeably better than the first, with a really gutsy nose, lemon, smoke - my brother suggested church incense, which was spot on. Palate not quite so impressive, although it got better with time and there is still enough acidity there to give it a little brightness. I will look out for 75 Mosel, they are still shining.\n",

      "Brought by Matt N - part of the lot we bought a while back from Acker internet auctions. Medium gold-brown. Very cidery with apple. Quite spicy. Seems much more mature and nowhere near as good as the previous bottle we had. Better on the palate, though at Szechuan Gourmet on 56th with Matt (and other non-wine-obsessed personnel). From a set of 5 purchased recently from Acker internet auction. Color\n",

      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "still lots of freshness in both smell and taste, rather lean wine. orange peel, honey, note of noble rot, still lively. would not surprise me if this one can hold on for a few more years. Best immediately after opening. Initially impressive (tasted beside the same producer's 1976 Auslese, which seemed at first thin and mean in comparison), but after 30 minutes it lost its verve and turned flabby. Low acidity, very sweet!\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Quite oxidized, almost maderized, but in the most beautiful way. Dark brown and vinous with a piney minerality which carried apricot syrup and ginger candy notes through the palate with hints of petrol and a nuttiness of toasted coconut, caramel and toffee on the finish. There were strings of creaminess that held the wine together and allowed the wine to bestow it's 'wisdom' on us over the course of 4 hours or so. Nice acidity and finesse throughout the stupendous finish. So rich. <br /><br />Drank with 4 dessert plates at Little Bird, Portland, OR. <br />1) Bay Leaf Crème Brûlée, oranges<br />2) Tarte des Demoiselles Tatin, crème fraîche<br />3) Coconut Cake passionfruit sorbet, pineapple<br />4) Tarte Nougat Poire ginger ice cream<br /><br />The Coconut cake was easily the best pairing for me.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "From magnum. Significantly low in the shoulder, spongy cork. Slightly musty on the nose at first, but that blew off quickly. Color was orange running into brown. Very sweet fruits and nut aromas, and flavors of the same on the palate, with the nuttiness winning out. Very much like a sweet oloroso sherry. Quite tasty, but not what it should have been if it had been stored properly.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Goldene Kammerpreismünze, Grosser Preis DLG. Full gold; overwhelming botrytis, raisins and honey, no VA; rich, ripe and luxurious, not broad or very complex but nice concentration, medium-sweet, harmonious; lovely length. Thoroughly delicious.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Silvaner\n",

      "Apricots and nuts, botrytis; still fresh in the mouth, moderate sweetness, round, lack a bit on the length, nose was best.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Very interesting to learn about this vineyard, which apparently used to be subsumed within Coutet and Climens. Speaks to the feminine and less rounded and viscous character of masculine/non Barsac Sauternais. Has a lovely tinge of acidity marrying its floral and apricot elements. Not overtly botrytis driven. Interesting as I drank 75 Coutet a few days later at while the differences were noticeable and measurable, one could still see some faint resemblance.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Red Bordeaux Blend\n",
      "Same bottle as Vinsanity. A treat from our hosts at Chateau Talaud over dinner. Light ruby color with lots of amber. This still had quite a bit of life left. Fairly light body, with cherries and flavors of tea that reminded me of the 1983 Beaucastel I had a few months earlier. Fully mature and fascinating. Clearly, fully mature. Light, elegant, with full game, leather, earth, tea leaf. Subtle wine, though clearly possessing textbook Beaucastel characteristics, though on a lighter scale. A treat.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Red Rhone Blend\n",

      "Toffee and cream on the nose, but actually quite lively on the palate, intense, sweet, oxidative - but ultimately heavy and worn out\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Copper colour. Quite an oxidised aroma; generic old wine character instead of obvious Riesling aromas. The sugar has dried up nicely, but it remains a fairly fat, low acid wine. One for necrophiliacs only (I must admit to quite enjoying wines even in such advanced stages of evolution).\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Yeasty, ripe green apple, and tasty. The yeastiness had a tinge of brioche and this bottle was definitely helped by the tiny bubbles... this wine still had life!\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "A generous gift from the winemaker... We had been treated to this wine during last year's visit - and this year Patrick Miolane sent us away with two bottles to go! We had one at dinner that evening and the other two nights later with dinner at another winemaker's house. Quite ripe, though with adequate acidity. Nothing oxidized or dried out about this one. Honey, butterscotch, intriguing minerality. Quite an experience - as pleasurable as it was fascinating.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Grenache Blend, Grenache\n",
      "I believe that this cuvee has only been made seven times ever. This is not a house that I know particularly well, but this wine was a stunner. A rich golden color led to a nose that exploded from the glass with everything from rose petals, lychees, a touch of lavender and melon. Think and rich with a level of acid that keeps the wine from being cloying, this is a legend.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Gew&#252;rztraminer\n",
      "No formal notes. Would have been fun to try this wine 6-10 years ago. Color very similar to an aged Sauternes. Great nose of dried apricots and aged honey. Initially tasted much like an aged Sauternes, but there was really no mid-palate and no finish to speak of. Was a quick ride (which is why the score was not higher), but delicious while it lasted. Light but a very fine auslese.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Deep golden/orange color - it almost looked more like whiskey than wine! Somehow it managed to be very heavy and thick yet very light and food friendly at the same time. The acidity was alive and kicking and balanced the sweetness perfectly. 36 years old and showing no signs of slowing down!<br /><br />Enjoyed with pork rillettes and salmon - great valentines day meal!\n",

      "After an afternoon of cruising down the Moselle River what better to drink than a fine aged Mosel Riesling. This bottle was very near perfection and showed exactly why we all cellar wine. Beautiful aged Riesling characteristics all in perfect balance. Deep golden color. Very complex aromas and flavors spanning white fruits, slight petrol and spices. A great experience. A bottle I'm likely to never forget.\n",

      "Orangey gold. This was grapey with qoo white kyoho grape in the nose with a bit of oxidative soy notes or one could say like a fino but a sweet one. With time, there was more pronounced toffee caramel on the nose. Suprising acidity with lots of mandarin peels and kumquats on the palate which had no structure but provided sparkle to balance off the sweet umeshu choya peach sweetness. Definitely beyond the best of its years and developed into an odd old man. A golden chrsanthamum tea colour with a glistening shine to it like liquid gold. Much fresher than the previous bottling, this was sstill spakling on the palate. Lots of pineapply lychee spices, nutmeg , tie kuan yin chinese tea leaves dry sweetness, a dash of sour plum powder and a generous helpin of almost botrytised apricots. Delicious for its age.

      "A real treat to try this as finding Foreau older than '89 in this country is pretty darn hard, but I was kind of hoping Don would save this for the Foreau-a-thon I've been talking about for at least the past 3 or so years. Shows the classic aged Vouvray character of marzipan, roasted nuts, apricot, mineral and earl grey tea, but retains freshness. Still sweet, but like the '76 Huets I've tried, there's a very strong acid backbone here. With air a little more of an orange citrus character establishes itself. Maybe a touch short on the finish, where the acidity asserts itself, but a lovely wine. A-.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chenin Blanc\n",
      "Unbelievable. The first of two bottles purchase at an online auction. My expectations were low. Right out of the blocks, this was fabulous. Almost bronze in color. Deep and uncuous on the palate with quince and aprocot in abundance. Weighty and langorous mouth feel. An amazingly long petrol finish. This is what great aged riesling is all about. Awesome and with years of life to go.\n",

OK, but firmly in the \"would have been better a few years ago\" camp. From jero. DOA. From 3L Bottle. Cranberry, earth/ herbal notes on the nose. Very high acidity. Not enjoyable at all on the palate. Past its prime.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Pinot Noir\n",
      "AP# 34016*009*77. Very deep gold. The nose shows plastic with notes of honey. Other tasters cited diesel, but I found this to be a lot lighter than that. This has a somewhat bitter note on entry with some lemon pith. This still has a lot of sugar with a very thick, glyceral texture. Medium finish. As with nearly any well aged riesling, this is pretty lovely, but it doesn't display the acid or complexity of other aged examples I have tasted. This is in a bit better shape than the last bottle. It is fully resolved. At first open the nose showed strong petrol, but after a few minutes it had blown off. The palate shows vanilla, lemons, and some astringency. Despite some signs of leakage, the bottle shows no signs of oxidation.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "This has 72.5g/l residual sugar.  Its a slightly lighter teak colour, tending towards a greenish tinged tan.  A little muddy on the nose and very figgy.  On the palate, its very much in the shadow of the 1978 and quite simply in a different league.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Terrantez\n",
      "Surprisingly alive and kicking especially given the price I paid for it. Awesome whyskey copper color and a big nose of honey, rotten leaves and library books. Clearly the highlights here.

      "AP No. 2 576 511 21 77. Unanimous wine of the night. Deep golden color. Another stunning and gorgeous nose of aged Riesling. Oh wow, such a sweet and sour tang, this is long and gorgeous with a luscious texture and an almost spicy note of sage. A few folks described it as \"spine tingling,\" and I have a hard time disagreeing. This bottle was acquired on release by the fellow who brought it, and it had not moved for 27 years, WOW! Best riesling I have ever had. Nose of diesel and hot oven with vanilla sugar cookies. This wine truly made my spine tingle.

WE had doubts about a1976 Mosel BA, but the viscosity and pure fruit proved once again the extraordinary life of well-made German rieslings. This bottle was not as crisply defined as some older Rheingau auslesen or Mosel BA wines, but instead was typical of Christoffel in that the viscosity and stronger center palate of fusel oil brought together the superbly concentrated loquat, orange, grapefruit and tropical floral tastes with the BA heritage quite intact. Allways a treat to try these matured mid 70s Rieslings from the Mosel. The cork was totally soaked and smelled like wet and rotten wood, but the wine showed all its beauty <b>1976 Jos.

      "Wine Variant: Scheurebe\n",
      "Awesome nose - florals, honey, grape must, sweet peppers and almonds. Just layers of it and the sweetness could even be sensed. Alas, tasted tired and flat with flat lemon-lime soda notes and a very porous texture. Wait and tried several times but to no avail. Just smelled it for the rest of the evening which was a treat. Old, concentrated Madeira color. Not dead by any means, but definitely old bones. Wonderfully complex nose of orange marmalade, candied tropical fruits, caramelized sugar, prune, and raisin. Malt and chocolate on the palate with persistent, bright, and intense flavors well supported by firm acidity. Something very unclean about the finish that makes drinking this a rather unappealing idea. Unchanged on day two. Hard to attach a meaningful number to, but an enjoyable experience overall.\n",

      "A wine from the estate of a deceased friend. Old, very old, clearly over the top but still enjoyable. Intense, mature golden color with amber reflections and a huge crystallization on the bottom of the cork and in the bottle. Impressive nose with scents of orange peel, caramelized apricot, spices and a touch of petrol. Very viscous and creamy on the palate, with sweet apricot and peach fruit, lots of botrytis, an oily texture and quite a low acidity. Harmonious but not too complex finish. Continued to show well on the second day, with nearly identical impressions. A good match to blue cheeses. Stylistically not my kind of wine, nevertheless a very interesting experience.<br /><br />Wijn uit de nalatenschap van een overleden vriend. Oud, zeer oud, duidelijk over zijn hoogtepunt, maar nog altijd best genietbaar. Rijpe, intens gouden kleur met schakeringen van barnsteen en met flink wat wijnsteenafzetting op de kurk en in de fles. Krachtige neus met aromas van sinaasappelschil, gekarameliseerde abrikozen, kruiden en een toets petroleum. Zeer romige, viskeuze smaak met zoet abrikozen- en perzikfruit, een pak botrytis, een olieachtige textuur en een vrij lage aciditeitsgraad. Harmonieuze afdronk, maar de complexiteit is er uit. Ook de volgende dag nog steeds aangenaam, met quasi identieke vaststellingen. Goed te combineren met blauwgeaderde kazen. Niet direct mijn stijl van wijn, maar desalniettemin een zeer interessante ervaring.\n",

      "Best vintage in decade. Orange colour. Nose is medium intensity, honey-briney, very balanced, &#1088;&#1086;&#1074;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081;. Palate is rich, burnt sugar, creme brulee, intense. Going on for ages. E. Tasted at the Prinz von Hessen treasury tasting in Schlosshotel Kronberg.\n",

      "Fantastic old bottle. Impeccable balance and nothing in moderation. Holy shit. Apricot, vinyl, diesel, molasses, coffee, banana nose that is expansive and intricate. Orange peel, spices, and madeira-levels of complexity on the palate, this is a wine to explore. Incredible.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Simply a gorgeous bottle. Started off slower than previous bottles, but this simply needed a lot of air. Well stored bottles are outstanding. From mag and ex chateau, this is simply breathtaking, fresh nutty and citrus nose, delicate yet layered palate, nice mineral finish, very very fine and even younger than the 90 Salon that I had recently, Much more driving and youthful.\n",

      "I found this wine to lack sufficient structure to balance the sweetness. The overall effect was of cloying sweetness.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "A classic Rheinghau Auslese, at its absolute peak and drinking gloriously. Nose was replete with fresh peach, dried apricots, butterscotch and musk, all tumbling out of the glass in a nicely botrytised package. While not as arresting in terms of balance as the 1971 Pfalz we had alongside, this showed plenty of freshness and a whole lot more power with round, delicious flavours just filling the lush, creamy palate - rich stone fruits, figs, vanilla, droplets of rubbery petrol, smokey minerals, orange peel - a very complete wine and absolutely addictive. Finish was perhaps shorter than the 1971, but with very respectable length, with dried figs and smoky caramel rounding off a wonderful wine.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Peaches and a touch of apple. some botrytis aromatic hints, but close to tired and faded overall. Some apple juice, botrytis, acid and spices; Bitter and dry. Not completely gone, but definitely over the hill\n",

      "Older Rieslings - Group #8, My #8.  Deep copper pink.  Unctuous tick texture.  Forward aroma of botrytis sweetness and orange peel.  Slightly sour thin o9range fruit.  Not as sweet or as thick as I expecetdd.  Hints of oxidation.  8/05\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Dark in color for a 76 Auslese. Rich round nose of orange blossoms, butterscotch, cararmel and baked apricot and apple. Big on the palate, very sweet for Auslese and very botrysized. Somehow very lacking in acid (which makes me think that since it is labeled without the grape listed that there is more in there than just riesling (which was definitely present but the lack of acid and presence the flesh and stone fruit made me think there had to be other varietals, Pinot Gris perhaps?). Interesting, but very one-dimesional and lacking brightness.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Possessing a drop dead gorgeous golden and amber color as well as an outstanding nose of dried apricots, flowers, crème caramel and white raisins, this wine was one of the highlights of the evening. Full bodied, perfectly balanced and with a seamless transition from the entry all the way to the finish, it was an effort to not gulp this wine. Showing a touch of sweetness, this had a long, fruit filled finish.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "The cork was slightly distended and the label torn at the edges, but the wine inside was still wonderful. It poured like a warm honey with long legs that circled the glass.

      "Original intention was to match roast goose, but on opening the cork was entirely saturated and although still a seal, oxygen has perhaps over the years taken its toll. Pale straw coloured. On the nose and in the mouth the overwhelming flavour is petrol. The fruit components have gone, with only a faint hint of apples remaining.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Developed deep golden appearance with turns to a neon green rim. Beautiful nose of petrole, pear essence, stone, marble, antique notes, schist, stewed parsnip. An off-dry palatte of very delicate tangerine, soft minerals, jasmine flowers, sauted pears, golden fig essence, golden raison, apricot skin, lemongrass, green tea leaf, a touch of mango. I expected this to be a bit more sweet, but it was so delicate and finesse driven, it seemed as though it was barley hanging on with continued acids and the roundness of botrytis. Awesome.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Soaked but sound cork. Medium golden; aged nose with dried fruits and mango; most of the sweetness gone, mellow with dried fruits and honey, a bit short.\n",

      "Last wine of the trip - This was a great match given that we had already eaten a lot of food and we still had 3 sweet desserts to go.

      "The nose reminds me of a peach pie, with the ripe, delicious peaches baked into a toasty crust, all topped with a touch of cream. The peaches from the nose show delicately on the palate, and they linger with the crust flavors as a touch of brown sugar sneaks across the palate on the finish. Lovely!\n",

      "Started with an old Grüner from the Freie Weingartner cooperative. I believe this was a recent release from the Domaines very large library of older wines. I have had this wine four times before and this was not the best showing but it was still enjoyable and proof that Grüner can age very well. <br /><br />Dark golden color. Slightly Oxidized. Honey, metal, mint and spices on the nose. Typical aged white wine profile that falls in between Chardonnay and Riesling. Initially a slightly damp or musty quality on the palate which eventually subsides. Minerality and graphite emerge on the palate along with a juiciness and a nuttiness on the very end of the finish that is surprising given the age. Overall an enjoyable wine that just falls short of excellence.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Gr&#252;ner Veltliner\n",
      "Orange-red brick color core with an orange-tawny colored rim. The wine had a funky nose almost to the point of being unpleasant, port-like upon first sniff and quickly moving on to a barnyard, muddy water, funkiness. Unfortunately, tasters generally agreed that the wine showed very little on the palate  tired and declining. Oh well.\n",

      "Tobacco, leather, cranberries, amazing light color that actually darkened as it sat in the decanter. Lovely and complex considering what it's been through in terms of age. 12.5% alcohol.

      "Hmmm, maybe I am a scrooge but I am not a huge fan of some of these older midrange Sauternes. A few older dYquems dazzled me, but a lesser Sauternes like this seem to get a real bitter, scorched burnt sulfury coppery metallic note on nose and palate. First off on the nosefreshly struck matchstick. Then coppery metallic elements. Once you are past that, more pleasant aromatics of dried orange peel, orange marmalade, walnut and caramel swirl in  nose and palate. I dont know, is the pleasure worth the pain? A few sips and I am done.\n",

      "32 years old! Slight oxidated nose, but can still make out the honey. There's wheat and truffles. On the palate, caramelized oak, rounded, yet still has acidity to hold up the wine. Slightly shorter finish than the rest of the vintages. This was a treat as I've never had white wine so old...\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Deep gold color, aromatic nose of flowers and nuts. Rich mature flavores. Cream cicle on the nose. Really creamy. Quite dry on the finish - could really be enjoyed as a table wine with rich seafood. Very enjoyable.\n",

      "Bottle and fill excellent, cork was wet to the top and extracted in 2 pieces. We drank this on an oppressively hot night and I think this affected both the wine and the tasting experience (when will I learn that Rose' is the only way in the heat?). Bright yellow gold and looking very healthy for its age at the outset. Very Meursault nose with big gunflint, coffee and citrus. It did not go well with a salmon dish (some asian and peach flavors) and in the heat seemed to age and get darker over an hour and a half. A mistake to try this wine on this night with this food.\n",

      "A beautiful wine, drinking perfectly now. Fabulous aromas of caramel, truffle, green lemon and morels. A truly fantastic wine fully resolved and beautiful.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Intense sesame oil aromas, followed by sencha tea leaves and an earthy edge. The palate has a somewhat pleasant oily textural element, but it suffers from a serious lack of depth and falls a touch flat at the end. The nose was more interesting than the palate, but this didn't hit any heights for me.\n",

      "This is the oldest White Burgundy I have ever had, and to be honest, I had no idea what to expect here. I had a feeling it would be at least a very interesting experience, but was hoping, as it is a Ramonet, that it would be a very positive one as well. In the end, I was very surprised",
      " and happy.<br /><br />Lovely Gold in color. Fantastic, unusual and somewhat shocking aromas, including honey, caramel, masses of citric fruit and some grass. Took me time to comprehend the aromas, as the combination and intensity were different than what I expected. It felt old, that is for sure. Taking a careful sip, (as I was really getting afraid of disappointment.. I mean how could anything match the quality my nose had experienced) revealed an intense and smooth full body white beauty, loaded with citric fruit, mainly grapefruit, combined with delicate doses of honey and more. Outstanding acidity combined with masses of complex fruitiness. Though it felt old, I was very shocked on how lively the wine acted. It was a VERY splendid surprise. I was actually really happy at that point, as I witnessed first hand on how incredibly well White Burgundy can reveal itself at an older age (had only enjoyed old Riesling till then). Overall this is an excellent wine, tasty, and highly exhilarating. What a fantastic experience!\n",

      "A late sub-in and disappointing after the previous wines. On it's own this might have shone more, but would never be a star.<br />The colour was a relatively deep mahogany and the light subtle nose was mainly tertiary nebbiolo aromas. On the palate the acidity sticks out and there's not enough body to balance it out. Pleasant, but no more and fading.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Nebbiolo\n",
      "One of those humble German wines that simply refuse to die even when almost 30 years old. Correct bright yellow; not unlike apple juice, fresh and sweet, acidity keeping the wine alive, the sugars have not been used up completely, some length; a bit acetic perhaps but keeping its balance. A fascinating curiosity.\n",

      "Had at Press restaurant in St Helena (Napa) as a super special birthday gift from my brother. This wine was gorgeous. It was sweet on the pallete like thin caramel syrup, a dark burnt golden hue in color. Smelled sugary & fresh & delicious. My brother wouldn't tell us the cost, but in my mind it was \"priceless\". What a gift !\n",

      "With c. 50g/l residual sugar, this was only bottled only two weeks previously.  A deep teak colour.  It has a nutty, fairly sweet, very attractive nose with some green melon fruit.  Lovely palate, with hints of the bitterness that is the hallmark of terrantez.  Round and very open with lots of lovely edgy acidity.  Theres a veritable firework display in the mouth.  A stunning wine.\n",

Nice golden color, very youthful bubble streams. Nose of yeast and nuts, oxidative. Flavor is very oxidative, with some dried fruit notes. Very enjoyable. Brass colour. Lots of mousse left. When I opened it there was still lots of pressure. Almonds, bread dough and apricots. Very intense nose. Very resolved flavours with a hint of caramel. Very dry.

The nose was nice right out of the gate, and only improved with air, to be high intensity, showing lemons, honey, and marzipan. <br /><br />The wine's texture was refined and light, as the flavors noted in the nose danced over my tongue. It took 2+ hours for the acidity to develop (although being Leroy, you knew it would come). While some may have found this a bit light and lacking weight, there was no doubting its attractiveness. This will last for years. I had not read fclarity's note below unfortunately and we drank the wine too quickly. I was nervous about the wine falling off fast and did not air it enough. My mistake. The bottle was beautiful and I agree with the descriptors below. Had we left it another hour this had the potential of a 93-94 grade.\n",

      "This is the fourth of 4 I bought a few years ago from Premier Cru after enthusiastic notes from Burghound and alan weinburg, and as usual, the last bottle is the best. Whoever thinks white burg cannot last (as did I) for a quarter century has never tasted this one. Is it because M. Ampeau keeps bottles in his icy cave for many years before releasing them? Or is there something about his vinification that preserves them? The color of this 26 year old is pale to medium yellow with no trace of gold. As soon as the wine is poured, there is an eruption of that classical Meursault smell of warm butter and hazelnuts. The flavor is equally superb and repeats precisely what the smell suggests. Rich, yet slightly reserved, with a deft touch of oak. Then, the finish surprises with a sensation of sweetness in what is clearly a dry wine. As if all this were not enough, the texture is pleasingly thick. The only criticism is that after about 30 minutes, there was a noticeable fading of the distinctive aroma and a slight thinning on the palate. Yet with its bright well integrated acidity, this wine could surely go on for who knows how many more years.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "nose Popped and poured quickly into champagne glasses. Some pressure upon opening and the cork was in very good condition. Some musty notes that blew off at first with faint bubbles slowly giving way. The wine develops intense aromas of creme brulee, biscuit, vanilla bean, nutmeg, resin and sherry. Heavy waxiness and a wonderful sense of creme brulee accompany a wonderful pitch to the nose. Clearly some oxidative elements given the sherry but balanced and drinkable (not overwhelmingly oxidated). On the palate, at first there is some vibrance and raciness that finishes with a waxy glide, but the wine fades after about 20 minutes in glass. We vacuum sealed a portion of the bottle and revisited a few hours later, but it was a bit more oxidized and on the sherry side. Hard to rate but there was some profound pleasure to be had at first. Provenance is likely key if one is to approach a bottle. Great experience drinking this wine. In the glass, the color was of light straw with few, if any bubbles remaining. Nose had some intense french toast, hints of maple syrup, rich honey and some mustiness - a really exciting, intense nose. The wine itself definitely seemed to have some oxidated characteristics to it, but most agreed that it wasn't bothersome in any regard. Creamy brioche with some toffee and creme brulee made this a fascinating wine to drink. Without the bubbles, it drank more like an old chardonnay. Superb champagne - this is still the best I have had. Maintaining a vibrant color, but less mousse and very small bubbles. Complex like a great wine, but still fresh and uplifting as a champagne should be. Great with fresh peach sorbet between courses. From memory. Superb. Incomparable with fresh oysters. Best champagne in my experience (perhaps not as extensive as some). Naso vivace e stratificato, con note caffettose che man mano lascian spazio a toni agrume. Bocca pazzesca, ancora aggressiva, con buon retrogusto di arancia candita. Meno buono dell'ultima bevuta, ma comunque ottimo. Perlage meno presente dell'88 ma finissimo, colore più scuro e terziarizzato, naso più spiccato e netto, nota elegantissima di arancia candita ed erbe fini. Sasso e mineralità ben fuse e ben presenti. Naso carico e pieno anche dopo molto tempo. Nel seguito escono aghi di pino e tracce di balsamico.

      "picked up at auction for just $26. Unbelievable. Volumes of fruit glide along a river of tamed acidity. A generous, but never cloying palate of honeyed golden raisins, toffee, caramel, white floral and warm stones. Delicious, clean and deep with a near 60-second finish. It was opened for 5 days and drank perfectly each and every one of them.\n",

      "It is very yeasty a la Krug, baked apple, burnt sugar, soft bubbles. Tasted on an evening with 12 other great bottles as Dom Perignon 1990, Salon 1996, Duval Leroy Femme 1996 and others.<br />These Champagne is opened at his peak Sampled 1/29/11. Color a deep golden color from age. The bead was all but entirely gone. Bummer. A moldy funk on the nose for about 30 minutes which blew off. You were left with the remnants of an exceptional Champagne. Butterscotch, toffee and truffles in huge volumes on the nose and palate with some Mandarin Orange marmelade on the palate too. A deep, full bodied and interesting aged white wine that was not unpleasant. Kind of like a slightly past peakl top notch chenin blanc. Certainly not worth the price, but if you get a bottle that was not stored on its side the majority of the the past 30 years, perhaps the cork stayed dry enough to be sufficiently expansive to keep the CO2 in. If so, I'd bet you'd find a 95 point Champagne inside.\n",

      "A shimmering light gold colour. My first sniff straight out of the bottle was not promising - very sulphurous, but given some air time, I felt that it really started to open up with wax, straw, petrol and citrus emerging. The palate was where the class and finesse of this wine really shone through though - super balance, style, structure and length! Might be one of the few '81s that will stick around for my 30th birthday\n",

It could be possible to find a drinkable bottle but it would have to have been stored in perfect conditions, which this bottle was not.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Tempranillo\n",
      "The cork broke but was easily remedied; the initial nose of powerful fruit and earth was stunning; then the tart strawberries and raspberries on the tongue told us what a treat this was; the nose softened over the next few hours; but the tart fruit remained; we sipped this through the whole dinner at Vie, but it paired the best with duck ravioli in a citrus sauce that was an appetizer; what a great bottle\n",
      "Wine Variant: Tempranillo Blend, Tempranillo\n",
      "Unique and unlike any of the other wines. The color was slightly bending towards brick though the nose nor palate showed this was going to die anytime soon. This in my opinion was the best wine of the night. With a complexity of flavor on a solid frame which added weight with time in the glass. Compelling. A thinkers wine. It should be noted that Andy Smith of Dumol felt that all the Calera wines if compared to Burgundy would equate to being much older in both color, smell and taste than a Burgundy of equal age.\n",

Fading slightly with age, this Climens had a light and aromatic fragrence with a hint of apple and citrus fruit. There was no botytis evident and the stucture on the palette was light and unusually dry. However, there was still the classic signs of clarity and purity in the fruit and nimbleness in finnish despite the age.\n",

      "Showtime! This was absolutely stunning from the get-go. We had this in a flight with the '83. Phenomenal wine. Perfect fill. The color is light straw. The nose is as mezmerizing as any wine I've tried. Grilled nuts, brioche, butterscotch and lanolin all there in a glorious symphony. Showing incredible intensity and length. The acidity is more detectable than the '83 and seems like it could hold on for several more years. The table was utterly silenced during this flight save some ewws and ahhs. I cannot put into words how wonderful this wine really was. I am certain though, I will be thinking about it for a long time. And all from a lieu dit! To borrow a phrase, Profound!\n",

      "honey and apricot, absolutely delicious. Sweeter than many sauternes, but I love it I have been fortunate enough to enjoy this splendid wine on several occasions and none moreso than last night. While this bottle was scored at 94, bottles from 4-5 years past I would have as high as 98. The last couple of bottles of this wine seem to be past their zenith and while still a stunning wine, doesn't reach the heights it has. The colour is a very deep rich gold, probably the equivalent of a d'yquem twice teh age... and the only wine I have had from outside France that could stand side by side with it. My young nephew with a sniff and a sip just said \"apricot\". Which is a dominant flavour. I would say dry apricot, rich acacia honey and maybe burnt orange dominate.\n",
      "Wine Variant: S&#233;millon\n",
      "In a word, amazing. From 750ml. Mid gold. Cumquat and marmalade, with an overlying patina of age. The wine is delicate and quite light-bodied. The botrytis-infused flavours have thinned out somewhat, but theres still a long luscious finish. Fascinating wine, and interesting to see how far recent vintages (fat, heavy, plump) have deviated from this original, purer style. Deep coppery gold colour with almost a redness. A nose of brassy apricots and fermenting marmalade. On the palate, some oaky tints and a general patina of orange peel contribute to the effect  and although theres some similarity to more recent vintages, the gradual fading of the lusciousness means the overwhelming impression is of a gently decayed richness. Still quite long on the finish, and a very moreish wine. Maybe the 375ml bottles have not survived so well, but this was a joy to drink.\n",
      "Wine Variant: S&#233;millon\n",
      "The only interesting wine in a restaurant's wine list, it came out with a really pale gold colour and few bubbles. Already evolved both on the nose and palate and developing very well with time. A classic vintage BdB performing surprising well.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "How does one describe old intensity and near perfection? The color was light and the cork was starting to protrude so why not open it? The cork came out in two pieces but was not soaked through. The initial smell made me think it was a bad bottle, but this quickly blew off and we were left with burgundy fragrance and cherry tastes which intensified with time and never faded to the last drop. 1982 must have been a terrific year for everyone smart enough to keep wine a long time and savor. It is finished but the memories will linger.\n",

      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Butterscotch, nuts, orchard fuits, lime, and popcorn here. Smoky minerals and more savory on the nose than previous offerings. A tremendous amount of palate presence here, almost grippy, and meaty if I have ever seen meatiness in a Chardonnay. A brilliant and mature wine that demands your focus. At its age, a totally different expression of the vineyard than the younger wines, that forces you to both think and passively enjoy its greatness. Would be great with food, and I love the savory flavors. Stylistically, I wonder if the 96 will turn into this wine? 96pts\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Visually a perfect looking bottle. Sourced from Christies in the early nineties to back-build a vertical. <br /><br />Colour Nose is somewhat oxidative but still sound. Palate is quite fat and the finish somewhat shrill. Ok but not great.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Decanted and consumed over the next 90 minutes. A rapid 3 part evolution. Medium yellow that lightened a shade after decanting. First, an ominous hint of full blown maderization. Then, it collected itself and transformed into old Chablis with truffled honey and then more typical sea breeze notes. At this point, medium to lighter weight for a Valmur but admirable backbone of minerality. Finally and quite suddenly, it collapsed into a toasty, oxidized ball of flames. The middle phase which lasted about 30 minutes was well worth it, though. Incredible show of liveliness for a 28 year old Chablis, at least for a while, but even I will admit that the wine is too old.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Chardonnay\n",
      "Medium brown, pears in syrup nose, botrytis, great acid balance, fantastic with the foie gras, this later faced the Yquem and took no prisoners, I wish I had more\n",

      "Dark yellow with an enormous viscosity. The bouquet reminds me of Hungarian Tokay but in this case very sharp; like enormously concentrated polish wax.

      "Wine Variant: Savagnin, Traminer\n",
      "Lovely golden colour with very few visible bubbles. On the nose there was no mistaking this for anything other than mature champagne. Walnuts, milk chocolate, cream and fudge came to mind.<br />The same goes for the palate, mik chocolate and nuts, but also sweet apples. The acidity is still very present and acts as nice counterpart to the otherwise sweet characteristics. A long dry aftertaste. More powerful than elegant but who cares?\n",

      "Medium yellow colour. Scents of plums, daffodills, shoe polish, and marzipan. Good intitial attack. Sweet and pleasant with great structure and harmony - precise and focussed with a somewhate perculiar, yet very pleasant taste of gun powder. The wine did seem closed, but there was greatness lurking behind the curtain. Balanced on the citrus-lime infused aftertaste. This is the oldest CduM I have ever tasted (recent purchase from Acker retail). While obviously showing age, it was definitely fresher than the '82 vintage Krug we had with it although the color was an identical burnished gold. While the vintage had no bubbles, the CduM had a few lazy dots slowly working their way up the flute. The family resemblance <br />of toast, molasses and citrus could be discerned in both, but all six of us preferred the CduM, mostly because the orange rind citrus note pressed by the CduM gave it a bit more balance. I was so enamored with the 88 next to it, that my memory is virtually blank. Anyone? Absolutely lovely but the normal 1982 Krug is one number bigger\n",

      "A mouldy oldy, courtesy of the man from Orlando. A light brick red with a brownish tinge. A faint whiff of VA perhaps? All secondary characters on the nose, with a slightly sweaty sock / rotting vegetable bouquet thats not unattractive. Certainly drying out on the palate  yes theres astringency, but its not overly hard. Medium body and medium length on the finish, it opens out nicely enough I think. Probably at its peak 5 years ago, I found it very enjoyable, but I could understand those with younger preferences decrying it as over the hill. On the other hand, for those who like relics, itll probably still provide satisfaction for another few years yet.\n",

The depth and the length were both outstanding. Superb - looked after bottles will probably get better over the next 6-7 years as well! Fin gyllende färg. Mycket mogen champagne på näsan , ingen oxidation utan mer honung, vanilj och smörat , rostat böd. Bra friskt smak för åldern. Var lite fel ute på det här vinet men då facit kom så var det en tydlig Belle Epoque. De tidigare Belle Epoque är oftast bra och med ett år som 82 är det ett säkert kort. Inte lika stark som 1985an men bra syra kopplat med en ganska frisk och bred bas levererade ett trevligt och bra vin. Nose of brioche, yeast. On the palate honey, brioche. Lacking the vibrancy of other 82s and definitely on its way out. Still a nice drink at the moment. This one was tasted as part of a vertical done at Perrier Jouet of their Belle Epoque 00, 99, 98, 96, 95, 88, 85 and 82 (see separate notes for the other wines). Needless to say this is a brilliant wine and on its own it would probably have been even better rated if it hadn't been for the 85. the 82 is very creamy and fat but a little bit more closed on the nose.\n",

      "This was one of two \"science closet\" type wines taken to dinner by Redteeth, Greenblanket and their respective senior managing partners. It was acquired by the \"Old World\" brother in-law when he bought out the cellar of a prominant Seattle restaurant that was going out of business and then given to me years later in a mixed case of \"chump\" wines (please see definition below). Given its vintage, twice orphaned provenance, and chump designation this wine served as powerful evidence of the ageablity of the wines of this appellation. It was quite fresh and lively with pear, citrus, honey and some diesel like elements on the nose. The palate was expansive with summer fruits, spices, wild flower honey, minerals, and considerable citrus acidity. Not super complex or incredibly nuanced this a lovely wine that is probably at its very best right now. <br /><br />(A chump wine, in the OWBIL parlance, is any wine other than a BV, Duhart or \"barber roo sko.\")\n",

      "beachrooster's wine, graciously accepted, shared, and enjoyed. There were several striking things about this wine. First the physical - the cork came out cleanly, the color youthful (I'd have guessed MAYBE ten years old, blind). And when I say the color and brilliance were remarkable, I mean I'm still confounded by it all. Anyone considering the value of the time and money it takes to age wines properly, need only have spent some time with this beauty. Aromas were all over the place - pears, apples, quince, slight petrol, river rocks, suggestion of honey and butterscotch, fresh cut white floral, just stunning and stayed that way for the following hour. Acids were waning, fruit, too, but nonetheless, the product of where this began and how long it's journeyed to get here were simply breathtaking. This is the reason I love older, well-cared for wines. 7,2% abv, drink now\n",

Lovely honeysuckle/ floral notes and palate is still fresh enough to make this enjoyable. Does show a slight burnt toffee character. Still looks like Puligny 1er cru but wouldn't keep it any longer.

      "[cork, 11.8%] None of my reference books seem to adequately cover this time in Australian wine history. I figure this is probably Barossa Riesling, but who knows? It looked pretty scary  who put pinot noir in a riesling bottle? I wondered  but although in the glass the colour hovered somewhere between amber and brown, the wine was still clear and glowing. A decadent coppery nose couldnt quite hide a metallic note underneath; the palate presents a wild concotion of cumquats, cold tea, malt, lychees and who-knows what else. It is drying out a little, and probably is past its peak. But plenty of sweetness remains, along with barely-reigned-in acid, all resulting in an intensely-flavoured, medium-length wine. A fascinating curio, and cellared since release! Fun to drink and marvel at!\n",

The aromas are initally low-intensity cheese, with a distinctly madierized note. Oh dear. All hope is not lost on the palate however. The bead is initially coarse, but settles down with time to a quite fine texture. Its certainly more than a prickle on the palate, and hangs on with some persistence. The flavours have yeastiness, but also veer towards nutty sherry-like qualities, browned cooked apples  all very aged. Its only really light-medium bodied, but its single biggest fault is the rather short finish. Structure survives, flavours are gone. Still perfectly drinkable, but probably only a shadow of what it should be. dried coriander, plums. Concentrated, acid revealed itself with time.

      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "Much fresher than the Rausch (of the same year) and surprisingly with better acids than the '93 Rausch spatlese - still kickin'... Healthy yellow color for age. Subtle, laid back nose. Rich for the Saar, but the fruit and sweetness are subdued. Clearly mature. Not fading in the least, but not terribly interesting either.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "At The Ledbury - at end of Clos des Ducs vertical. Developed, very complex nose - minerally, petrolly, some blue cheese, redolent of the church with incense and even a note of musty hymn book. Light on the palate, but with that delcious oily texture and a long, complex, fresh finish. Lovely. Very rich; packed with golden apples and other ripe orchard fruits that have a sweet, honeyed quality to them. With time this starts to feel a little heavy, lacking the acidity to carry the immense weight and not showing the same depth or elegance as the Bockstein.\n",

      "alcohol 7.8%..just thought i'd mention it This is an auction bottling, AP 14, from CT it looked liked it was actually a Long GK (capsule was long, but without another to compare to unsure). Cork was a little protruding, and apparently slid right in. Advanced color, but still a very enjoyable wine. Petrol, apple pie, slatey mineral notes. Excellent length. This probably isn't up to a pristine bottle, but I enjoyed (and drank a lot!). A-/B+ Light and fully mature. Lots of baked apple.<br />B+\n",

      "Nose shows a bit of promise with apricot, botrytis characteristics and as Gavin mentioned, Sultana. The palate is disjointed, alcoholic, spiky and finishing short. Darkish brown like expensive rosewood. Lusciuos elegance of dried mahogany apricots, a whirl of nostril filling richness ! The one with most depth , exhibiting toasty mocha toffee covering pristine clear and bright apricots and golden sultanas with tinges of cigarette ash. Mouthwatering at its age and really perfectly balanced. Excellently poised. A pinnacle of an example of aussie botrytised sweet wine. Maybe not a sauternes but this is truly aussie at its best! A gorgeous wine!\n",
      "Wine Variant: S&#233;millon\n",
      "The nose is full and dark with apricots, and molasses sweetened with sugar appearing Despite the darkness on the nose, the wine is still tart on the palate. A mint note appears, as well as some heat and austere apricot flavors. The acidity is full all the way through, and some molasses flavors appear on the finish and linger for a while. Very interesting right now.\n",

      "Deep garnet color with no evidence of bricking. Lots of funk on the nose upon opening with alcohol predominating. Over 90 min, gave way to a light, delicate, floral perfume. Very tight to begin with, this eventually opened to reveal some notes of leather and cola on the palate. However, there was never any weight or body to this. Opened in celebration of Drew's 28th birthday at Wildfire Restaurant in Oakbrook.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Cabernet Sauvignon\n",
      "Quite complex and very youthful -- lemon oil and dusty mineral scents on the nose. A touch of heat is the only thing that brings you to California from something Corton-like. As it warms, a bit of caramel and pineapple emerge. Very solid showing for this. Kalin makes some surprises.\n",

      "Purchased a 375ml bottle off the wine list at Del Rio restuarant in Highwood. Amber-brownish color. Aromas and flavors of walnuts, almonds, sugar wafers, and burnt caramel. The wine was actually not that sweet, with acidity driving the pulse. Light-bodied, not syrupy or cloying. Finished with a slightly bitter note of tangerine rind. Interesting wine.\n",
      "Wine Variant: White Blend\n",

      "Wine Variant: Port Blend\n",
      "Colour is clear and strikingly light for its age. Very uncommon bouquet and that makes this wine very hard to determine when served blind. This not very expressive, I would call it modest, and showes impressions of a weedy kind of herbs, fennel, lettuce, apple-sauce and some vanilla. Its body is slender but intriguing like a ballet-dancer's. Of course this wine misses some stuffing, weight and fruit, but still is brisk, vibrant and fresh. Probably past its best, though very interesting and fun to drink.\n",

Greatly exceeded my expectations. A delightful surprise.\n",

Low intensity, slightly musty but not unattractive aromas of wet leaves and old cupboards hardly reveal at what is to come, because the palate seems to be missing in action. It has some gently prickly acid, but the flavours seem to have departed altogether. The wnie has gone, only the liquid remains. Theres no oxidative nuttiness, no volatility, just",

      "It might live in cement for close to 20 years but there is a solid streak of oak on the nose. Such power and structure, this seems to be a very masculine Sauternes. So young. Light gold colour. Aromas of white flowers, spice, honey, and a whiff of plastic. A little muted on the nose. Medium-full bodied, spicy, with apricot, peach, orange rind. Good acidity and nice texture. Moderate finish, ~35s, with hints of orange rind and honey on finish. Still seems quite young. Medium gold. Honey and bothrytis, lots of lemony fruit and some carmel. Very sweet but very balanced. Bought at the Chateau. Enfin! Première expérience avec un Gilette! Le vin tient très bien sa réputation. Bien que nous ayons bu un millésime assez récent du domaine (il faut savoir que le Château Gilette conserve ses vins durant une vingtaine d'années dans d'immenses cuves en béton avant de les mettre en vente), le vin est évidemment d'une belle sagesse.<br /><br />Belle couleur or foncée. Nez très particulier et très charmeur sur des odeurs de desserts Première expérience avec ce vin mythique. Il ne ressemble à rien de ce que j'ai pu voir à Sauternes jusqu'à maintenant dans ma vie. Au nez, c'est très explosif sur des arômes de gâteaux, d'oranges et de poires. En bouche, c'est d'une grande intensité au plan des saveurs et le vin me semble très jeune encore. L'équilibre est admirable et la finale des plus acceptables. Certes ce vin n'a ni la grâce d'Yquem ni sa puissance, mais il ressort à sa façon comme étant très expressif, bien fiselé et extrêmement précis en bouche. Ce vin a une longue vie devant lui, je le garderais 25 ans sans problème encore!\n",

Well, both times I put this wine in my mouth I nearly lost it on Roy's tablecloth. This was truly that insipid. The wine shows very faded color wih spicy dill, pickle juice and cinnamon on the unappealing nose. The palate is surprisingly sweet, almost too sweet, spicy, slathered in wood. It finishes out thin and gets a retch each time. No thanks.\n",

There was a touch of sulphury pungency on the nose, but this blew off quickly leaving honey scents to come to the fore.

      "$67 restaurant list price. Perfectly stored since release. Light, youthful color. Initially, a whiff of petrol, which faded quickly into the backround as an intriguing smokiness stepped in. This is a beautiful, dry Riesling. I couldn't get my nose out of the glass - the complex aromas kept changing and evolving, revealing another layer every few minutes, it seemed. Excellent balance on the palate, with a highish acid level / tension contributing to the overall impression of youth / freshness.

Dry for a Demi-Sec with apple and pear flavors. There's a strong lanolin note and the usual acid spine, but it could use a little more flesh. Night two and it's opened up just a little more while picking up a cheese rind and bitter green almond character, but remains lean. B+.\n",

      "From a magnum. Still has a young-looking, bright color that's just starting to turn yellow, but it tastes perfectly mature, with a rich, almost sumptuous mouthfeel and flavors. It isn't exactly honeyed but it definitely does suggest a sort of confiture of blanc de blancs flavor.

Apart from the 'villages' label it was suggestive of premier cru quality, and was much preferable to any similarly-scored Chardonnay I've reviewed recently. After 25 years this wine possessed more clarity, clearly defined quality, and life than the majority of whites I've consumed in my lifetime. It was surely in the ballpark of the Montrachet appellations, but also possessed distinctive qualities. Less nutty characters, more golden pear and rich apple flavors, paired nicely with vanilla oak and a stunning acid complex. I'd swear by this til death.\n",

But a stellar match with the foie gras and squab confit, bringing out the savoriness of the foie with the salt crystals in the dish balancing out the wine's monolithic sweetness. Burnished brass in color, clearly an older wine but plenty of life left. Baked apple and apricots. Good acidity. Would drink now, but a small amount left two days later hadn't changed much. From memory. Like the 1985 LGK, rather blunt.\n",
      "Wine Variant: Riesling\n",
      "A difficult wine for me. My expectations were very very high and I was pretty let down. There was nothing wrong with this wine, but it was thouroughly unimpressive, also. Very clean, but no interesting notes on the nose and seemed to be missing the mineral component that I want in my Mosel Riesling.\n",

      "Lovely mature nose with baked apples. On the palate this champagne is very harsh, a bit oxidised and very acidic. Is it supposed to taste like this or is it a flawed bottle? Anyway, I think this one will keep for ages, but not necessarely improve too much.\n",

      "Served with New Zealand St. Pierre Poached Aiguillette with Saffron Fumet, Tomatoes and Tarragon. Wonderful white Burgundy, deep brassy in color with expansive delineation of chalky mineral soil streaking back and forth across the palate with frenzied energy. The bouquet combines great minerality with an alluring sweetness of candy corn and butterscotch.\n",

From the list at The Modern in NY. An absolute stunner from a producer I've never heard of, much less tasted. Light yellow in color, incredibly fresh with high distillate-like tones and some dried peach. Long, regal, smoky, and dry on the palate, very much in the style of Trimbach but avoiding austerity. This was just a great older Riesling, and all the more pleasurable since I had no grand expectations or preconceptions about it. Incidentally, the restaurant has a marvelous list of older wines from Alsace (Rieslings going back to the '70s), many of which are from producers that are less well known and less sought after, at least in North America. Based upon the condition and quality of this bottle, I would gladly return to try others.\n",

      "Diffuse on the nose with pear, mint and mineral aromas. Its still youthful on the palate and perhaps even slightly tauter in the acidity department and less sweet than the Prüm, but its not showing as well as the Prüm. It just doesnt have all that much stuffing behind it to make it interesting, or to stand up to the acidity. B+/B.\n",

Instead, some faintly stoney, gently cedary aromas emerge, with honey overtones. Minimal nuttiness. Inititally feels soft on the palate, yet the acid is still there, providing a freshness thats somehow lasted 20 years. Persistent finish, in some ways sweet  I wonder if theres just a dash of botrytis helping to lift things? Remarkably good wine by any standard. A different era  the back label confidently states cellaring recommended. Long time gone since thats appeared on a bottle of chardonnay costing so little\n",

      "Stunning nose of repressed wild strawberries, molasses, and a touch of dried herbs. Rich and complex with a hint of coffee and mint, the color is classically slightly murky but does not detract. The entry is bright and slightly wanting.

Nice long aftertaste. Drink now.\n",

Should have saved it for a nice occasion in the next several months.\n",

Le Château Doisy-Védrines est un second grand cru classé de Barsac en 1855. Les vins du Sauternais ont la réputation de vivre vieux, est-ce que 23 ans est trop vieux pour ce vin ? La question se pause. À première vue la bouteille est correcte, pas de marque de coulure, le bouchon est bien rentré. Il y a des dépôts de gravelle au fond de la bouteille. J'ouvre alors la bouteille, le bouchon se brise, merde, je l'extirpe de justesse avec une pince à cils. Je le verse le vin est d'une belle couleur dorée, il a encore de la vie dans ce vin. Le nez est puissant, avec des pêches compotées, sucre brun et agrume agrémentent le tout. La bouche est par contre différente. L'attaque est agréable, soutenue, puissante. Le milieu de bouche est correct avec un bon botrytis mais la finale...une légère touche oxydative se fait sentir. Le vin a commencé à décliner. Il commence à être trop vieux. Bon vin tout de même dans son ensemble. www.vinlongueuil.blogspot.com Color golden orange color; pronounced intensity, orange citrus, caramel, apricot, sweet baking spices; high acidity, great balance, full bodied, citrus fruit, honey, minerals, long finish; excellent quality and great balance.

Again, some strange flavors on the palate....that walnut oil, dried roses, tea, fermenting dried berries, strawberry patch.

      "I guess this was opened to refresh the palate and there was no beer in the house. I've never been a huge fan of this vintage. To me it's like getting raked across the face by a cat's claw and then having lime juice and salt splashed in the wound. It stings! The nose of this bottle is completely overwhelmed by sulfur. I'm sure it blew off with time, but given all the other opened goodies on the table, I didn't go back to it. The sulfur doesn't show up on the palate, surprisingly, but this wine is all about structure and minerality. It's lean with bitter green and yellow citrus. The structure is enamel stripping and almost seems tannic. While I like it, it veers a little too much into that fine line between pleasure and pain zone for my tastes, but everyone else around me seemed to enjoy it more than I did. B+.\n"
